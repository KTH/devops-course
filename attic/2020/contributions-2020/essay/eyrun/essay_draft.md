(Ops team)
An operations team, sometimes referred to as IT (operations, cite), will more often than not do all of the operational management of a system, such as responding to tickets from external or internal stakeholders, where they will relay any new feature requests to the development team, and maintenance of the system and incident management and response. Summed up an operations team will keep the lights on and the fires out after a handover from the development team at the end of the development cycle. The operations team would handle customer relations meaning there was a barrier between developers and customer contact and it is important for them to generate value for stakeholders as well.  

- Intro to changes to team structure creating DevOps, with context for need for changes in development cycle
..* Motivation for agile with corporate context + agile manifesto
(back to from IBM to Google)

There is a need for teams to be responsive in system maintenance [cite] as well as dealing with potentially rapidly changing requirements.
For these reasons one of the main parts of DevOps is to shorten the development cycle as a whole, that is, reducing the time it takes for development to go into production. It promises continuous delivery without removing software quality.  
Development and Operations become a responsibility that is shared by all members of the team, increasing agility and flexibility which is very important in the rapidly changing technological environment of modern times.

###What makes a good DevOps team

- DevOps team composition, what makes a team?
- Why is culture so important?

..* Collaboration
For good collaboration you need to have communication. Make sure everyoneâ€™s voice is heard. The team works as a whole and encourages the whole to work towards a common goal.
No more rock-star developers that know the inside-out of a product. Now the whole team has to be onboard and involved, everything needs to be tested and no more arguing and blaming back and forth between development and operations.
The DevOps team also has to prioritise customer requirements and relations, there is now no barrier between the developers and the stakeholders.

..* Communication
..* Transparency
..* Diversity
A good team is a diverse team, you need a team with someone who is the tech star that is updated with all the new cool stuff, you need someone that reinforces good agile practices and you need someone with good knowledge of businesses processes to keep on top of the operations side of things.

..* Summary


###DevOps teams at scale
- Needs more looking into

###What is the DevOps team of the future?

- Future challenge: DevOps in distributed teams
..* Reflection on current situation with covid making us work from home. Mostly speculative but with some input from corporate culture management from already distributed teams (github, bandcamp) and how they create culture.

..* Potential future challenges for DevOps teams
Not looked into at all, but hoping to find some interesting things, if not this part is pretty boring or pure dreaming  

- Futuristic corporate culture
What are current corporate trends in tech culture and what do they have to do with DevOps?
