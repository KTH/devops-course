## Description
Docker is the most popular way of running containers but people have raised safety concerns with Docker. An alternative to Docker is Podman, which is a deamonless way of running your containers. We want to investigate the benefits of running containerized applications using a daemonless container platform and explore if these benefits outweigh the downsides of running it in this fashion.
