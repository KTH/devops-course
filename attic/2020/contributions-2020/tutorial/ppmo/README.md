### Member:

## Description
This tutorial shows how to setup a Jenkins server using Docker, connecting plugins to it, such as Sonarqube and the Repairnator.

It can be found here: https://github.com/Paul-Philip/devops-tutorial

## Structure

* Starting up Jenkins and Sonarqube with docker
    * Giving some background information of how different docker commands work and why we use them to set up our pipeline in this scenario

* Configuring Jenkins to connect to the Sonarqube and also adding the Repairnator plugin for future use.

The criteria (4 needed) I mean to fulfill are:

* The TA can successfully execute all the commands of the tutorial
* The tutorial gives enough background
* The tutorial is easy to follow
* The tutorial is original, no such tutorial exists on the web
* The tutorial contains fun facts or easter eggs
