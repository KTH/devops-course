## Topic
Zerocode introduction video

## Issue
We would like to contribute to an open-source project, namely https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode.


The project has an issue where they want a short video demonstration of Zerocode. 


We think this contribution would be appreciated as the issue is labeled as _help wanted_.
This contribution could also improve the documentation of the project in a way, as it will 
help new users get familiar to Zerocode. 

The issue can be found here:
https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode/issues/231

Since this Zerocode is about API automation and testing frameworks, 
we think this contribution falls under this topic:
https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/issues/9


## Result

We received some guidelines on how we could improve our video for our task repetition. Here is that list and how we solved them.

* _add intermediary slide frames to clearly see the separation of the 5 parts mentioned in the original issue._

We added 5 slides to clearly show the 5 parts.
 
* _the background before zerocode at 2:07 should last at most 20 sec._

We decided to remove it and call it part 3 instead. It now shows the slide Part 3 for 5 seconds.
 
* _Don't spend more than 2 seconds on a single sentence of bullet point_

We made every bullet point 2 seconds long.
 
* _Snippet at 0:10 should be bigger and explained_

We got a larger snippet and added some explanatory text
 
* _2:23: avoid big pieces of text, 12 words maximum per bullet_

We have ensured that every text/bullet point should be at a maximum of 12 words.
 
* _all screen captures are too small, use larger fonts and better resolutions_

After discussing with Long Zhang we have decided to zoom in on the screen capture, to let the user see clearly the important parts
 
* _for all screen captures, add subtitles that clearly explains what happens_
We added explanatory subtitles to the screen capture, where we explain what is going on.
 
* _highlights important parts on screen where the viewer must focus_
We used red boxes in and zooming in to highlight the important parts.
 
* _add a take-home message slide, a credit slide_
We added a take-home message and a credit slide at the end.
