## Topic

Adding monitoring to an API for a personal website

## Details

I will add monitoring of stats like response time and status for requests sent
to my API. The monitoring will be visualised with something like grafana or
prometheus. This will allow me to create a better understanding of how the API
is used. I will also add persistent logs in order to make it easier to trace
errors.

The demo will show how the data monitored is captured and also how it's
displayed.
