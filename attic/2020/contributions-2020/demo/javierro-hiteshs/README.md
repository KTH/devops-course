Kubernetes Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Visualization with [kube-prometheus](https://github.com/coreos/kube-prometheus)

## Demo

In the demo we create a deployment with a web server, and we configure it to enable autoscaling. Then, we generate traffic and provide visualization to better understad the web server's behavior.

## Feedback session

In the latest version we enhanced our demo with the feedback provided by or classmates, such changes include:

  - Reduced total video duration to less than 5 minutes
  - Music volume lowered.
  - Faster and clearer introduction.
  - Clearer take-home message.
  - Explanin previously unaddressed reference to Minikube
  - Used arrows in-video to better direct viewer's attention
