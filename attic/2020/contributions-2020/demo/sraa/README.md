## Topic

Test Amplification using dspot

## Details

As part of the demo, I would like to demonstrate what is test amplification, its benefits and how it can be achieved through dspot.
I would like to show the steps to setup dspot and various options that can be used along with dspot. I have a personal project on Genetic Algorithms. I will demonstrate dspot on a sample of those testcases. The files will be available in github for anybody who want to access them.
