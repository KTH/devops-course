## Title
Git Repository Health -- As measured by the bus factor and other metrics

## Motivation
An interesting measurement to assess the health of a software project in the "bus factor": the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a bus before a project is incapacitated. Researchers have proposed algorithms to evaluate this number based on git history. 
In this presentation we explain this concept, its potential usage and the algorithms proposed to compute it.
