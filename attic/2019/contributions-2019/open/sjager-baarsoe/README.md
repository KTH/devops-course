# Repo Monitor

## Open suggestion: 
We will build a (HTML based) widget that shows information about a repository that is being worked on. This will help developers to see activity in the repository without having to browse to GitHhub and refresh the page all the time. We will use the GitHub REST API. The widget will be generic to be applied for any repository that a developer has access to and want to see information about. We will apply CI/CD practices and document everything in a README.md file.
