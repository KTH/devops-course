## Rules


To pass the course, the student has to collect 4 grades:
* The grades are in category: "[presentation](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2021/grading-criteria.md#presentations)", "[essay](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2021/grading-criteria.md#essays)", "[video demo](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2021/grading-criteria.md#video-demos)", "[executable tutorial](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2021/grading-criteria.md#executable-tutorials)", "[contribution to open-source](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2021/grading-criteria.md#open-source-contributions)", "[course automation](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2021/grading-criteria.md#course-automation)", "[feedback](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2021/grading-criteria.md#feedback)" (choose four out of them, at most one in the same category, it is not necessary to cover everything).
* The [grading criteria page](grading-criteria.md) is the unique reference which explains how to pass / pass with distinction.
* The strict deadline for essays, tutorials, contributions to open-source, course automation is April 30, 23h59 Stockholm time; and "[demo](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/tree/2021/contributions/demo)"; the strict deadline for repeated tasks (all) is May 31, 23h59 Stockholm time.
* The student proposes a category and a topic, which is discussed and accepted by the TA. The proposal is made as a pull-request on this repository. The four graded contributions must have little overlap.
* The same student cannot choose the same topic for two different tasks. The four tasks should cover different aspects of DevOps.
* 4 Pass means a final E, 3 Pass / 1 Distinction means a final D, 2 Pass / 2 Distinction means a final C, 1 Pass / 3 Distinction means a final B, 4 Distinction means a final A
* Group work is encouraged (max 3 persons) but you cannot be with the same persons for more than 2 projects. You can do a work alone for one or at most two projects.
* A failed task requires to pass it again at the end of the course, based on the feedback from the failure. A repeated task cannot be passed with distinction. A task can only be repeated once.
* If the whole course is failed, no grades are kept if the student registers again to the course the year after. 
* After a proposal has been merged, the topic of that proposal cannot be changed.

Group Rules
* When you send a pull request for registration, please follow the name convention of using email addresses of two members to create the folder: email-email.
* We recommend 2 students. Three is also possible for ambitious essays, demos or contribution to open-source.
