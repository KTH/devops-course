## Rules


To pass the course, the student has to complete and pass between 3 and 5 tasks:
* The tasks are in category: "[presentation](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2023/grading-criteria.md#presentations)", "[essay](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2023/grading-criteria.md#essays)", "[demo](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2023/grading-criteria.md#demos)", "[executable tutorial](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2023/grading-criteria.md#executable-tutorials)", "[contribution to open-source](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2023/grading-criteria.md#open-source-contributions)", "[feedback](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2023/grading-criteria.md#feedback)" (presentation and demos are mandatory, at most one in the same category, it is not necessary to cover everything).
* The [grading criteria page](grading-criteria.md) is the unique reference which explains how to pass each task category.
* The student proposes a category and a topic, which is discussed and accepted by the TA. The proposal is made as a [structured pull-request](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2023/.github/pull_request_template.md) on this repository. The 3-5 graded contributions must have little overlap.
* The same student cannot choose the same topic for two different tasks. The 3-5 tasks should cover different aspects of DevOps.
* Deadlines:
  * Deadline for presentations and demos: the day and time they are given in person
  * Deadline 1 for essay / tutorial / open-source: April 11, 17h Stockholm time
  * Deadline 2 for essay / tutorial / open-source: April 24, 17h Stockholm time
  * Deadline 3 for essay / tutorial / open-source: May 8, 17h Stockholm time
  * Deadline for feedback on essays or katacodas: 48 hours after delivery for a given deadline
  * Deadline for repeated tasks (all): **May 22, 17h Stockholm time**.
  * The deadlines are strict and cannot be extended. Not meeting a deadline means failing the task / the repetition.
* Final grading scheme
  * A: 5 completed tasks 
  * C: 4 completed tasks 
  * E: 3 completed tasks (excluding feedback)
* Group work is encouraged (max 2 persons) but you cannot be with the same person for more than 2 projects. You can work alone for one or at most two projects.
* A failed task requires to pass it again at the end of the course (repeat), based on the feedback from the failure. A task can only be repeated once.
* If the whole course is failed, no grades are kept if the student registers again to the course the year after. 
* After a proposal has been merged, the topic of that proposal cannot be changed.

Group Rules
* When you send a pull request for registration, please follow the name convention of using email addresses of two members to create the folder: email-email.
* We recommend 2 students. Three is also possible for ambitious essays, demos or contribution to open-source.

**Lab sessions**

* Lab slots are not mandatory. They are given in person (preferably) or videoconf.
* During the planned lab time slot, please use this [Queue](https://queue.csc.kth.se/Queue/DD2482) for booking online meetings
* Specify your zoom meeting link when you register the queue

**Examinations**: Some tasks require physical presence (presentation, demo), others do not (essay, open-source, feedback).
