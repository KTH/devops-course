## Rules


To pass the course, the student has to complete and pass between 3 and 5 tasks:
* The tasks are in category: "[presentation](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2022/grading-criteria.md#presentations)", "[essay](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2022/grading-criteria.md#essays)", "[demo](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2022/grading-criteria.md#demos)", "[executable tutorial](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2022/grading-criteria.md#executable-tutorials)", "[contribution to open-source](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2022/grading-criteria.md#open-source-contributions)", "[course automation](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2022/grading-criteria.md#course-automation)", "[feedback](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2022/grading-criteria.md#feedback)" (choose four out of them, at most one in the same category, it is not necessary to cover everything).
* The [grading criteria page](grading-criteria.md) is the unique reference which explains how to pass each task category.
* The student proposes a category and a topic, which is discussed and accepted by the TA. The proposal is made as a pull-request on this repository. The four graded contributions must have little overlap.
* The same student cannot choose the same topic for two different tasks. The four tasks should cover different aspects of DevOps.
* Deadlines:
  * Deadline to complete task 1: April 5, 17h Stockholm time
  * Deadline to complete task 2: April 19, 17h Stockholm time
  * Deadline to complete task 3: May 3, 17h Stockholm time
  * Deadline to complete task 4: May 17, 17h Stockholm time
  * Deadline to complete task 5 (optional): May 23, 17h Stockholm time
  * Deadline for repeated tasks (all): May 31, 17h Stockholm time.
  * The deadlines are strict and cannot be extended. 
* Final grading scheme
  * A: 5 completed tasks 
  * C: 4 completed tasks 
  * E: 3 completed tasks (excluding feedback)
* Group work is encouraged (max 2 persons) but you cannot be with the same persons for more than 2 projects. You can work alone for one or at most two projects.
* A failed task requires to pass it again at the end of the course, based on the feedback from the failure. A task can only be repeated once.
* If the whole course is failed, no grades are kept if the student registers again to the course the year after. 
* After a proposal has been merged, the topic of that proposal cannot be changed.

Group Rules
* When you send a pull request for registration, please follow the name convention of using email addresses of two members to create the folder: email-email.
* We recommend 2 students. Three is also possible for ambitious essays, demos or contribution to open-source.

## Communication

* All communication for the course DD2482 should be sent to <dd2482@eecs.kth.se>.
* you create issues here if you think the question is good to be discussed publicly, the rules of [netiquette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etiquette_in_technology) fully apply.
