To pass the course, the student has to collect 4 grades:

* the student proposes a category and a topic, which is discussed and accepted by the TA. The proposal is made as a pull-request on this repository.
* in each category, there are suggested topics, listed on issues in this repository (for instance [#9](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/issues/9) lists topics about testing)
* each grading category, there is a grading form, which explains how to pass / pass with distinction.
* 4 Pass means a final E, 3 Pass / 1 Distinction means a final D, 2 Pass / 2 Distinction means a final C, 1 Pass / 3 Distinction means a final B, 4 Distinction means a final A
  * for the competition, the distinction is given to the top-25% best performing teams
