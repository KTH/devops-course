## Short summary after the first lecture

we are happy to spend 4 intensive hours with you to discuss DevOps. Here is some update for those who did not come to the course. 
*  The pre-generated group sheets are the suggestion instead of the mandatory.
*  We have decided to drop the numbering of the groups due to poor maintainable. So there is no need to create an issue to update the group sheet.
 * When you send a pull for registration, please follow the name convention of using email addresses of two members: email-email instead of the group number.
* We added four folders under the presentation corresponding to four slots of presentations, please add your pull request to the correct folder.
* For each presentation session, we take about 8 groups. The rule is first some first merge.
* We greatly appreciate you can 1) send the pull request to the correct folder 2) follow the name convention and 3) make sure the file is properly documented with the names of you and your partner and your preliminary topic.
