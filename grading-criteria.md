## Video Demos

The concept: Students prepare top-notch demonstrations and deliver them as an online video. The demonstrations are really DevOps. For example, a demo typically involves multiple virtual machines, likely deployed in the cloud. A demonstration is scripted and lasts 3 minutes. Students are required to prepare a video of the demo. 
There will be two sessions, each one  with half of the students. During a session, the other half of the students,  the course teaching team, as well as invited guests (colleagues, industry collaborators) watch the videos and provide feedback. 

Among the guests, some are "critique" (in the sense of [culinary critique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_critic)), they are here to assess the relevance, the difficulty, the sublime and the originality of the demo. As food critique, those critiques are anonymous: as a presenter you do not know if a person in the audience is critique or not.  Some students will be randomly assigned the critique role on a voluntary basis.

|                                             | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|-------------------------------------------- | ----|----|-------------|
|The demonstration is clearly motivated (why it matters for Devops?) | Yes | No | Relates to a hard problem |
|The demonstration is difficult to do | Yes | No | Relies on a non trivial infrastructure |
|The demonstration is original | Yes | No | The are less than 10 demos on the topic on Internet |
|The video is sublime (eg visually appealing) | Yes | No | Excellent narrative |
|The video contains an [easter egg](https://github.com/OrkoHunter/python-easter-eggs) | Yes | No | Related to the demo |
|There is a code repo to run the demo  | Yes | No | Code repo with a solid readme |
|The video must contain subtitles which are clear and in proper English | Yes | No | Clearly understandable voice over |
|The video includes a take-home message | Yes | No | Actionable takeaway |

To pass, you must have at least 4 "yes".
To get a distinction, you must have at least 2 "remarkable".

 Criteria for the selection of the open-source project:
 - The project is related to DevOps
 - The project has more than 10 Stars
 - The project has more than 100 Commits

The concept: you create an executable tutorial about a specific technology related to Devops. You deliver your tutorial on an appropriate platform, such as [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/), [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) or similar. If the tutorial runs locally, the tutorial must run on Linux.

An executable tutorial is not a youtube video.

|The tutorial is easy to follow  | Yes | No | Well documented |
|The tutorial is original, no such tutorial exists on the web | Yes | No | The teaching team never heard about it |
|The tutorial contains [easter eggs](https://github.com/OrkoHunter/python-easter-eggs) | Yes | No | Subtle and fun |
|The tutorial is successful (attracts comments and success) | Yes | No | Lively discussion |
|The language is correct | Yes | No | Interesting narrative  |

To pass, you must have at least 4 "yes" and the TA assessment.
To get a distinction, you must have one browser version and at least 1 "remarkable".

## Course automation

The concept: you create an automation task for the course to improve the teaching experience and effectiveness (eg a Github action task). Simple tasks can be bundled in a package to get a pass.

Make sure that you meet the following requirements in your final submission:
1. The automation task (ex., Github Action) should be implemented in a stand-alone repository, not as a part of the Deveops-Course repository. For example, you can do this by [publishing your Github Action in the Github marketplace](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace). The final submission must include a link to the repository that implements the task.
2. You should demonstrate that your automation technique actually works and automatically produces some results. For example, you can fork the Devops-Course repo and activate the implemented Github Action on it and show how it works by making changes in your forked repo. In case of this example, a link to your forked repository should be included in the final submission.

To get a distinction, you must pass and have at least 1 "remarkable".


## Feedback

The concept: you provide constructive and timely feeback about one task from categories "essay" and "executable tutorial".
The feedback is provided in a written manner, as a well-structured comment on the PR of the task.
This constraint means that to register a feedback task, you must also register either an "essay" or an "executable tutorial".
