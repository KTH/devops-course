## Video Demos

The concept: Students prepare top-notch demonstrations. The demonstrations are really DevOps (typically involve mutliple virtual machines, likely deployed in the cloud). A demonstration is scripted and lasts 3-5 minutes. Students are required to prepare a screencast of the demo (in case of problems, such as demo effect, persons who cannot attend to all demos, etc).

There will be two sessions, each one  with half of the students. During a session, the other half of the students, plus the course teaching team, plus invited guests (colleagues, etc) go from demos to demos, in small informal groups. 

Among the guests, some are "critique" (in the sense of [culinary critique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_critic)), they are here to assess the relevance, the difficulty, the sublime and the originality of the demo. As food critique, those critiques are anonymous: as a presenter you do not know if a person in the audience is critique or not.  Some students will be randomly assigned the critique role on a voluntary basis.

|                                             | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|-------------------------------------------- | ----|----|-------------|
|The demonstration is clearly motivated (why it matters for Devops?) | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|The demonstration is difficult to do | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|The demonstration is original | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|The demonstration is sublime (eg visually appealing) | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|The live demonstration contains an easter egg | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|The audience can play / directly interact with the demo  | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|The demonstration triggers a conversation  | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|A screencast has been made (optional) | Yes | No | Remarkable |

To pass, you must have at least 4 "yes".
To get a distinction, you must have at least a good screencast and at least 2 "remarkable".

Criteria for the screencast:
* The screencast is less than 3 minutes
* The screencast contains subtitles which are clear and in proper English
* The screencast contains a good and concise take-home message at the end

## Open-source contributions

The concept: you contribute to open-source projects related to DevOps and get merged pull-requests.

|                                             | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|-------------------------------------------- | ----|----|-------------|
|The contribution fixes bugs | Yes | No | Remarkable (hard bugs) 
|The contribution improves documentation | Yes | No | Remarkable (big documentation improvements)|
|The contribution adds new features | Yes | No | Remarkable (hard features) |
|The contribution is much appreciated by the community | Yes | No | Remarkable (highly praised)|

To pass, you must have one yes.
To get a distinction, you must have at least one remarkable contribution.

 Criteria for the selection of the open-source project:
 - The project is related to DevOps
 - The project has more than 10 Starts
 - The project has more than 100 Commits
 - The project has an active community on GitHub

Note: we are all aware that this assessment is subjective by nature. In case of disagreement, the informed judgement of the professor is the final decision.

## Executable Tutorials

The concept: you create an executable tutorial about a specific technology related to Devops. You deliver your tutorial on an appropriate platform, such as [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/), [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) or similar. If the tutorial runs locally, the tutorial must run on Linux.

An executable tutorial is not a youtube video.
