## Tutorial proposal: Set up an Apache Web server using docker

This tutorial aims to give basic understanding of how to use docker and docker images.

### The 3 main points of the tutorial will be:

1. Set up and run Apache.
2. Handle ports to and from the container.
3. Create persistent storage, since the image itself is stateless.

The tutorial will be created on katacoda.

### I aim to fulfill the following criteria:
* The TA can successful execute all the commands of the tutorial (mandatory)
* The tutorial gives enough background
* The tutorial is easy to follow
* The tutorial is doable in the browser without a local environment
