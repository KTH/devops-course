## Tutorial proposal: Set up an Apache Web server using docker

This tutorial aims to give basic understanding of how to use docker and docker images with network communication.

### The 3 main points of the tutorial will be:
1. Set up and run Apache and an SQL DB via docker (separate containers).
2. Handle ports and communication between the Apache container to the Db container.
3. Create persistent image storage (volumes or bind mounts), since the image itself is stateless.

Each step will include a small introduction and/or discussion of the relevant topic. Ex. step 3 will introduce and compare volumes and bind mounts. 

The tutorial will be created on katacoda.

### I primarily aim to fulfill the following criteria:
* The TA can successful execute all the commands of the tutorial (mandatory)
* The tutorial gives enough background
* The tutorial is easy to follow
* The tutorial is doable in the browser without a local environment
