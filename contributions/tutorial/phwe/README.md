### Tutorial proposal: Set up an Apache Web server using docker

This tutorial aims to give basic understanding of how to use docker and docker images.

The 3 main points of the tutorial will be:

1. Set up and run Apache.
2. Handle ports to and from the container.
3. Create persistent storage, sicne the image itself is stateless.

The tutorial will be created on katacoda.
