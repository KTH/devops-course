### Description

VSTS is a team foundation server in a cloud. It's been around 13 years to help teams, managers, software developers to manage
there developing efforts. It helps with source code, project plan, automated build, automated deploy, testing, bug tracking as
well as to manage all kinds of developing stuff. With VSTS, it is possible to get all of these services but in a cloud. Because
of that no need to worry about running or backing it up as Microsoft is dealing it on the behind in the cloud. It is possible to
have the same features on the on-premise version of TFS. Azure DevOps Is the new version of VSTS. Same functionality but more 
features. As it has been observed that Microsoft has changed a lot from it's a website regarding visual studio team services name
to Azure DevOps, all of the tools and extension in the Azure portal have been modified too.  So in this tutorial, we will show:

* Which changes have been made regarding VSTS into Azure DevOps?
* How to use Azure DevOps to manage code
* How it is related to DevOps like automated releases, automated deployment
