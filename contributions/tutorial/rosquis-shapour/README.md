**Topic:**
 
Cloud-based error monitoring using Sentry.io. 

We would like to learn more about monitoring and error tracking. Sentry.io seems like a beginner-friendly alternative and we want to know more about how to use it in our own applications. 

#### Tutorial:
- How to set up the platform (including installation and setup)
- How to use the platform (the dashboard etc) in your own programs 

We will provide a background with information regarding monitoring and error tracking, but also explain the main princples of Sentry.io. We will also provide a step-by-step tutorial showing the setup and how to use the platform, in a way that is easy to follow. The tutorial will include fun facts/easter eggs that gives the viewer extra information that could be fun and useful to know about.

We are aiming for the *distinction* pass. The Grading Criteria we aimed to fulfill are:

**The TA can successful execute all the commands of the tutorial:** We have tested the tutorial on different persons that all managed to successfully execute the commands, so there should not be any difference with the TA:s. 

**The tutorial gives enough background (remarkable):** We provide an introduction to Error Monitoring that do not require any previous knowledge, and we also explain why the topic is relevant in DevOps. 

**The tutorial is easy to follow (remarkable):** The tutorial is suitable for persons without any previous knowledge about Sentry/Error Monitoring, since we guide the user through each step in detail. We also provide pictures that clearly show what to do at the differnt steps. 

**The tutorial is original, no such tutorial exists on the web:** We think that our tutorial is original since we could not find any tutorial about Sentry that is doable in Katacoda. There do exist different tutorials about Sentry on the web, but they are not related to DevOps in the same way as ours. 

**The tutorial contains fun facts or easter eggs:** The tutorial contains fun facts, for instance about the history of Sentry and how it was founded. There are also many cool facts mentioned in the tutorial that can be useful for many developers (like the integration with slack and the features mentioned in the “what’s next”-part). 

**The tutorial is doable in the browser without a local environment (remarkable):** Yes! Everyone can try the tutorial in Katacoda with just the link.
