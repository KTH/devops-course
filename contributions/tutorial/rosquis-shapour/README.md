Cloud-based error monitoring using Sentry.io. 

We would like to learn more about monitoring and error tracking. Sentry.io seems like a beginner-friendly alternative and we want to know more about how to use it in our own applications. 

#### Tutorial:
- How to set up the platform (including installation and setup)
- How to use the platform (the dashboard etc) in your own programs 

We will provide a background with information regarding monitoring and error tracking, but also explain the main princples of Sentry.io. We will also provide a step-by-step tutorial showing the setup and how to use the platform, in a way that is easy to follow. The tutorial will include fun facts/easter eggs that gives the viewer extra information that could be fun and useful to know about.
