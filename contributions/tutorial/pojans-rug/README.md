##### Proposal
We want to create an online tutorial which takes the user through the process of contributing to an open source project.

The aim is to expose the user to all of the git commands you need to know in a realistic scenario that tie them all together.

##### Target audience
This tutorial is aimed at students that have experience with coding, but not necessarily has used version control to participate in development of a large project.
