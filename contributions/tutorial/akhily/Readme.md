## Description:

ServiceNow is a cloud-based platform that offers IT Service Management, Customer Service Management, Governance Risk and Compliance and 
other software as a service (SaaS) which has rich out of the box features. Manual deployment of update sets (scripts, business rules, workflows) among various ServiceNow 
customer instances (Test and Prod) has been cumbersome for a ServiceNow developer. Custom integration with Jenkins or deployment of a CICD server requires manual configuration of the 
application which is not available out of the box. However, ServiceNow "Orlando" release recently solved this problem by introducing a CICD spoke which can be
leveraged by using flow designer (An automated flow) that triggers the deployments with approvals. This tutorial covers the mentioned feature and provides an
implementation guide on how to integrate the application with version control and deploy the application to various SN instances.

The target audience aimed for this tutorial are ServiceNow admins, developers, customers and other enthusiasts on service management platforms like
Salesforce, ServiceNow, BMC Remedy etc
