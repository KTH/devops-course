## Description
Asp.net core 3.1 microservice deplyoment to openshift

We would like to make a tutorial for deploying the newest version of asp.net microservice to Openshift.

We've not had any experience with this and we couldn't find any topics regarding this version of asp.net, so we though this would be a useful tutorial.
