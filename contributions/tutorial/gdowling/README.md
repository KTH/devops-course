# Mutation testing with PIT

Pitest is a tool for evaluating your test suite using mutation testing.

My tutorial aims to, in chronological order:
- first show how to install it as a plugin for maven
- run the basic commands
- then showing that it is something useful by using it on one good test suite and one bad one
- and then going over some of the customization options and when you might want to use them
- maybe something else if I can think of something interesting related to this topic or this program 

I will either make a youtube video or a katacoda tutorial. There are a few tutorials or demonstrations of mutation testing with PIT on youtube but they may leave out some key parts, being too long, or bad microphone.
