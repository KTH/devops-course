## Description
One of the benefits with Git is that it is free and open source. Anyone can host a Git server, but yet most users rely on third parties like GitHub or GitLab to host servers for them due to the complexity of hosting. This tutorial aims to show how to host your own Git server in a simple way using Docker. 

The tutorial will be interactive through Katacoda.

## Outline
1. Setting up your Docker server
2. Installing Git on your server
3. Pushing and pulling files on your repository
4. Configuration, security
5. Front-ends (gogs, gitea)

## Novelty
There are some existing tutorials for hosting Git servers, such as [on linux.com](https://www.linux.com/training-tutorials/how-run-your-own-git-server/), however these tutorials donâ€™t bring up security measures or adding front-ends. Furthermore, they are not interactive.
