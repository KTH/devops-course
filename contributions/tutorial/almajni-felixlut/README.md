### Group members:

Felix Luthman (felixlut@kth.se)

Nour Alhuda Almajni (almajni@kth.se)


### Topic:
Docker

### The novelty of the tutorial
- The tutorial will run in
[Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/nour95/scenarios/final-docker), so you don't need to
install anything in your system.
- The tutorial will use the terminal extensively.
- The tutorial will have a background and will explain the relationship to Devops.

This tutorial will also explain the main commands and steps to:
- Run an already existing container in your terminal (Katacoda).
- build your own container that may have apache and other dependences.
The tutorial will listen to port 80 (in Katacoda).
