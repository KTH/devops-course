We have aimed to reach a "remarkable" for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th critera below.

Hope you enjoy the tutorial! :)

# Tutorial: Docker
*Team members: Christina Sunnegårdh (sunneg@kth.se), Klara Eserstam (klaraes@kth.se)*


**Interactive task:** Dockerizing a client and a server (node.js/react) in an application  separately (using docker compose).

We feel like there is no current tutorial that gives a good background on docker as well as also shows how to dockerize a client/server application and outlines when/why one would do that. We aim to provide a complete guide for this for someone who is new to Docker.

#### Structure
- Background
    - Overall info, what docker is/what it can be used for
    - Information about the task (when/why it is preferable, advantages etc, “case”)
- Tutorial part
    - Explaining commands used
    - Execute the commands on Katacoda



#### The criteria (4 necessary) we mean to fulfill are:
- The TA can successful execute all the commands of the tutorial (mandatory)
- The tutorial gives enough background
- The tutorial is easy to follow
- The tutorial contains fun facts or easter eggs
- The tutorial is doable in the browser without a local environment (needed for distinction)
