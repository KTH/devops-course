# Proposal
A tutorial going from not using any CM-tool to using Ansible and also Ansible Vault to encrypt sensitive information

# Description
IaC (Infrastructure as Code) is a core feature of DevOps.
Typical tools enabling IaC are Configuration Management tools, there are many different tools out there. At work we have ansible in place, and I would like to learn more about it so I was planing on making a tutorial where you set up a simple environment with Ansible and then also using Ansible Vault to encrypt your sensitive information.
