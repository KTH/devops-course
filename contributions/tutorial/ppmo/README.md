# Proposal
A tutorial showing how to add an SCA automatic repair tools in your work flow

# Description
A lot of software developers have good pipelines with SCA tools like sonarqube and integrated into their IDEs however, it is not always the case that the developers act on the warnings they receive from these kind of tools. I will look into what kind of automatic repair tools are out there and create a simple tutorial on how these can be added to your pipeline.
