**Members:** Emelie Tham (etham@kth.se)

## Structure of Topic
1. What is BuildBot?
   1. BuildBot vs other CI/CD Tools
2. What is Cypress.io?
   1. Cypress.io vs Selenium
3. What is E2E testing?
   1. E2E testing vs Unit testing
4. Installation instructions
5. BuildBot setup instructions
6. Cypress setup instructions
7. Tests runs on the BuildBot and Cypress setup.

**Motivation:** I was interested in learning about how to apply CI/CD to my existing projects as well as using Cypress.io tool. In the Cypress documentations there was a page that showed how to setup continuous integration with Cypress and provided some examples on how to do so with popular CI/CD tools CircleCI, Jenkins and Travis CI. However, I did not see any on BuildBot. Upon searching the web there seemed to be no tutorials on this either.
