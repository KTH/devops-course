## Tutorial topic
We propose to create a tutorial that showcase a possible toolchain of helpful tools that would assist in making sure the application is in a desired state at the end of development.

This would include tools that handle the following key points
* code analysis
* testing
* obfuscation (and minimization)
* compilation

### Goal
With a completed tutorial, one should be able to chain these tools together, making it a very effective process that is essentially automated.
