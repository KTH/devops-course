# Tutorial Proposal - Code obfuscation tools for Python

## Members

## Tutorial topic
We propose to create a tutorial that covers different code obfuscation tools available for Python, their techniques and differences as well as showcase some results obtained from using them.

The current tools that will be examined and covered(might change with more research done on the subject)
* pyarmor
* cython
* py-minifier

### Goal
After going through the tutorial, the reader should have a better understand about what tools are available for Python obfuscation, why it might be desirable to obfuscate code, as well as a good idea of how obfuscated code might look.
