## Devops related
I haven't even convinced myself entirely that modelling belongs in devops. But i think it can be a great tool to assure quality and keep better track of a project. Here are however three sources which implicates that modelling can belong in devops:</br>
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/299911373_DevOps_meets_formal_modelling_in_high-criticality_complex_systems </br>
https://devops.com/modeling-place-devops/ </br>
https://modeling-languages.com/devops-modeling-workshop/ </br>

But this is essentially up for discussion.
