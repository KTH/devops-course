**Topic:**
Github Apps and Actions

Both Github Apps and Github Actions provide ways to build or integrate tools that are useful for the toolchain in DevOps. We would like to learn more about how to set up and install different types of Github Apps and Actions to a repository. Therefore, we want to create a more general tutorial on how to set up and install Github Apps and Actions. To make the tutorial easy to follow, we will also use real examples from the Github marketplace.


#### Tutorial
Our tutorial aim to show how to:
- Give some background information about Github Apps and Actions
    - Github marketplace
    - Difference between Github Apps and Actions
    - Advantages and the usage of them
-  Find different parts/steps that you need to understand and do to be able to install and integrate the Github App or Action
    - Yaml files
    - Webhooks
- Show real examples where we install and integrate Github Apps and Actions to a repository (at least one example for each part above)
    - Step by step guide
    - Use pictures for the most difficult part
    - Video-tutorial for one of the parts
