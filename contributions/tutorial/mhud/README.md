##Description
Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) is a team foundation server in a cloud. It's been around for 13 years to help teams, managers, software developers to manage their developing process. It helps with source code version control, project planning, automated build, automated deploying, automated and manual testing, bug tracking as well as managing dependencies.

With VSTS, it is possible to get all of these services in the cloud. Because of that, there is no need to worry about running or backing it up as Microsoft is handling this in the cloud. It is possible to have the same features on-premises as well.

However, Microsoft changed the name of VSTS into Azure DevOps, where Azure DevOps has the not only same functionalities but more features as well. All of the tools and extensions in the Azure Portal (that offer services that can be used and connected to the features in Azure DevOps) have been modified too.

### Agenda
So in this tutorial, it will be shown:

How to use Azure DevOps to manage code.
How to create a Build Pipeline to build and publish code to make it ready for release and deployment.
How to create a service on Azure Portal and use it by deploying release to it.
How to create a Release Pipeline to create a release and deploy the code to the service created on Azure Portal.
All of the steps described above will be demonstrated by showing how to apply all these to create this tutorial.
