## Topic
An introduction on how to use unit testing, regression testing and code coverage with IntelliJ. 

Testing is an important software engineering practice and necessary to keep the state of quality of the software product or service under test. We will focus on Unit testing and regression testing. Code coverage provides critical information about where to focus testing, and is an important metric in Software testing.

We are planning to publish this on medium, katacoda or some forum that fits the tutorial.
