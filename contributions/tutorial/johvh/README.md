## Description
Grafana is an open-source visualisation and analytics software. The tutorial will show how to setup Grafana on a remote server and how to create useful dashboards and panels for a program.

Steps in the tutorial:

1. Setup a remote server (will use Digitalocean).
2. Setup Grafana on server.
3. How to access Grafana remotely.
4. Create some example program that generates data to visualise.
5. Create dashboards & panels visualising the data in step 4.

I want to do this tutorial because visualisation and analytics of data is an important part of devops.

Criteria I want to fulfil:
- The TA can successful execute all the commands of the tutorial (mandatory)
- The tutorial gives enough background
- The tutorial is easy to follow
- The tutorial is original, no such tutorial exists on the web (there are a few tutorials on how to install it on a digitalocean server but none show how to integrate it/actually visualise data)
- The tutorial contains fun facts or easter eggs
