# Topic: GitOps with K8s & Flux CD

Sigrún Arna Sigurðardóttir sasig@kth.se @s1grun

# Description

In this tutorial I will go over the following steps:
- Create a K8s cluster in Azure
- Setup Flux using Helm
- Deploy simple service using Flux
- Configure Continous Deployment 

Considerations:
- Can I assume or refrence other tutorials for:
  - Azure CLI already setup 
  - Sufficent privilidges in Azure
  - Docker for desktop already setup 
  - DockerHub access to be able to push images


Refrences:
