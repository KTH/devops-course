## Topic

I would like to create at tutorial on how to use Flask-MonitoringDashboard in your Flask Web-application,
I could not find any tutorials on this subject more than the documentation on the Flask-site. This is something that I have never done before 
(both creating a web-app and using monitoring).

## Outline
- Introduction to monitoring
- How to install and set up Flask/Python
- Set up Flask-MonitoringDashboard
- Display and explain selected features
