## Description

This tutorial will be about how to use Declarative pipelines and how to use Jenkins user interface to build a pipeline 
to compile a demo maven java app and run the unit tests whenever the code is pushed to a repo. The idea 
is to show two different ways of doing the same thing.

I will try using katacoda to make this tutorial. However, if there are some issues regarding using katacoda, 
i will demostrate how to install jenkins locally on a computer, and do the tutorial locally.
