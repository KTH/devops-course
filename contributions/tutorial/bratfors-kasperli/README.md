## Description
A tutorial that teaches the reader how to install and setup Travis CI, a continuous integration tool, on GitHub. The tutorial should be easy to understand for anyone with experience in GitHub, but not necessarily with continuous integration. Travis already has a good, official tutorial so the novelty of this tutorial will come from the fact that it will use visual cues from video/images to help the reader through it.
