A tutorial that explains what is fuzzing and how to use the tool [radamsa](https://gitlab.com/akihe/radamsa) to generate random tests on your program. 
A very recent tutorial already exist on the web. [How To Install and Use Radamsa to Fuzz Test Programs and Network Services on Ubuntu 18.04](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-radamsa-to-fuzz-test-programs-and-network-services-on-ubuntu-18-04). We will follow it to get started and then choose a different angle and go more in-depth. We want also to make a tutorial less OS-dependent.
