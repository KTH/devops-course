## Proposal
----
we will introducing different type of test coverage in this tutorial, include : 
1. Functional Coverage
2. Statement Coverage
3. Decision Coverage
4. Condition Coverage

and how to generate the code coverage report with jacoco and junit test

## Motivation
----

Testing is an important part in DevOps, it make sure your integrations not changing the past features, but just fixing bugs and adding new features. Test coverage is one of the important criteria in testing as it tells developers which line of codes had been fully tested and which is tested partially or totally not reach in test. It convince developers that the product will work as assumed by high code coverage tests.
