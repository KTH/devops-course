# Tutorial Proposal: BuildBot
**Team Members:** Sandro Lockwall Rhodin (<sandror@kth.se>) and Aristotelis Kotsias (<kotsias@kth.se>)

**Description of the Topic:** 
BuildBot is a CI-tool which can be used to automate a number of tasks such as testing and compiling. We intend to produce a tutorial on how to perform installation setup for BuildBot in a Docker environment utilising KataCoda and then also how to setup a functioning GitHub integration. If we for whatever reason cannot get the KataCoda environment working properly we will instead produce a tutorial for how to utilise BuildBot locally (paired with GitHub). The tutorial is to either use GIFs or Video content to expand upon (and hopefully simplify) the aid one might otherwise find in the documentation of BuildBot. 

**Structure of Tutorial:**
1. Information about BuildBot, where and how it is used.
1. Installation instructions, either paired with KataCode instructions (since it supports Docker) or just local instructions.
1. BuildBot setup instructions (including GitHub integration instructions)
1. Test runs on your BuildBot setup

**We are trying to fulfill the following Grading Criteria:**
* The TA can successful execute all the commands of the tutorial (mandatory)
* The tutorial gives enough background
* The tutorial is easy to follow
* The tutorial contains fun facts or easter eggs
* The tutorial is doable in the browser without a local environment (eg on https://www.katacoda.com/) (optional)

Hopefully we can get some originality in there as well, since there doesn't seem to be too many BuildBot tutorials out there. 

# Completed Tutorial
