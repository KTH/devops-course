### Description

A step-by-step tutorial on how to get started with a code coverage tool on your Github repository and integrate it with a CI solution. More specifically, the tutorial covers how to set up Codecov on a Java-Maven project on GitHub and provide reports through Jacoco on CircleCI. There is existing documentation of each of the tools mentioned but I have yet to find a beginner-friendly step-by-step tutorial that covers how to integrate them with each other.

Outline:
  
  - What is code coverage?
  - A comparison of code coverage tools.
  - A motivation why Codecov was chosen for this tutorial.
  - Before we begin, set up your repository and CI-solution.
  - Setting up Codecov
  - Reading your first coverage report.
  - Easter eggs / additional content.
  - Limitations of CC, an example.
