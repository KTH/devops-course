## Tutorial suggestion: Code Coverage

### Description

A step-by-step tutorial on how to setup and use a code coverage tool on your Github repository and integrate it with your CI solution. As an example I would suggest covering how to setup a Python or Java/maven project with Codecov or Coveralls. Each solution of course already have some documentation but I have yet to find a tutorial that is thorough and goes through all the steps mentioned below: 

Suggestions:

- A small introduction to code coverage.
- A comparison between existing solutions and a motivation of how the solution covered by the tutorial was chosen.
- Prepare the repository (if necessary).
- Setup the code coverage tool.
- Integrate the tool with your repository.
- Integrate the tool with a CI solution.
- A few examples on how to use the CC-tool.
- Hopefully I will find some easter eggs to cover when I dive into the topic.
