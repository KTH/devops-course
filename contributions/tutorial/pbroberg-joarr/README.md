Automated testing using Lambdatest.

Automated testing is really useful when working in larger application projects. We would like to
learn more about the process of creating an automated testing environment and while doing so, also creating an
easy to follow tutorial on how one can get started and use Lambdatest for their automated testing.


#### Tutorial
Our tutorial aim to show how to:
- Setup an automated testing environment with Lambdatest
- Add and remove tests
- Navigation and understanding of the Lambdatest UI


#### We are looking to fulfill the following criteria:
- The TA can successful execute all the commands of the tutorial (mandatory)
- The tutorial gives enough background
- The tutorial is easy to follow
- The tutorial contains fun facts or easter eggs
