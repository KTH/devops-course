## Topic 
Azure DevOps Pipeline Tutorial

## Description
Describing & implementing features of Azure DevOps and explaining how it provide one stop environment for implementation of CI/CD pipeline with ease.
As far as scope of the tutorial is concerned, we wish to present the basic implementation of Java code using the features provided by Azure Cloud. Here, this Java or NodeJS are nothing but a random code just used to demonstrate the implementation of Azure CI. We are using only Azure features and YAML for the implementation of pipelines.
It also includes, demonstrating the introduction and little implementation (not exhaustive) of Boards, Repos and Artifact- this is done to demonstrate how gracefully Azure DevOps is providing all the DevOps and Agile tools interconnected under one roof. Apart from that, the implementation of the pipeline will be more robust, using some random open-source JAVA project.
It includes creating basic CI pipelines on Azure, providing creating a basic CI pipeline, how the user can customize the CI pipeline, involving approvers intervention in the pipeline for pushing the code to the next higher environment, how the code coverage is checked in Azure DevOps, what are 'tasks' and how we use it in Azure DevOps. It does not cover any specific test cases or test apps but we will try to include basic tests to demonstrate how they are taken care of during CI process in Azure, we will be using Linux VM (if possible in free tier). This all demonstration will be done on actual Azure DevOps environment and the document will carry sufficient screenshots for guiding the steps. It might be possible that we may not be able to write simple/ self-explanaotry details in the document due to overwhelming relevant content of CI/CD in Azure DevOps. But I don't want to reduce the scope as we have spent time in gaining the understanding and would like to express it there as much as we can.

In one like I would say it will help to understand Azure DevOps in an Agile project implementation of an organisation.
