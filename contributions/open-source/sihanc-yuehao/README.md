## Proposal

We would like to contribute to the open-source project [seldom](https://github.com/seldomQA/seldom/) and [HTMLTestRunner](https://github.com/SeldomQA/HTMLTestRunner). **Seldom** is a python WebUI/HTTP automation testing framework based on Selenium and unittest and it can be simply downloaded with pip ([see releases](https://pypi.org/project/seldom/)). **HTMLTestRunner** is the component seldom largely depends on and it can automatically generate elegant testing reports after selenium testing and send testing report to users' email. The contribution will fix SMTPServerDisconnected bugs, and also add mail compatibility, which can help users with different emails to send testing report to mailboxes over SSL. The contribution will also add responsive design to fix webpage scaling problem.
