## Category

## Description

The discord bot is made for the Python Discord server. It is written in Python and makes use of Docker to run.
I'd like to contribute to this project as I think software bots are useful and I will learn how to set them up through this task.
This is related to DevOps as it falls under software bots.
The project should be fine to choose as it has more than 10 stars, more than 100 commits and a pretty active community on GitHub with the last merged pull request being merely 4 days ago.

I would like to work on two issues that are related:

https://github.com/python-discord/bot/issues/2171

https://github.com/python-discord/bot/issues/2170

The first is a bug that requires adjusting a command that should be able to take multiple users as arguments, but for now it only accepts one.
The second follows up on it by cleaning up the help text for the command, so it should be considered as adding to the documentation.
There is also a decent possibility of the contribution being merged as well.

**Submission**

The two issues have now been addressed.

Here is the PR for the bugfix:
https://github.com/python-discord/bot/pull/2178

This is the PR for the added/improved docs:
https://github.com/python-discord/bot/pull/2179

Hopefully they will also be merged soon.
