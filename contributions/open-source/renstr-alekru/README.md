## Proposal

The open source project [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) is used as a way to run your [Github actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) locally instead of having to push your changes to your repo everytime you want to test changes. 

Our contribution is aimed to address the following bugs [#598](https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/598) and [#597](https://github.com/nektos/act/issues/597).
