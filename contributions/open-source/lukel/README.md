## Category

Contribution to Open Source

## Description

I want to contribute to the [DevOps Exercises repository](https://github.com/bregman-arie/devops-exercises). This repo contains exercises on various topics which tie in to DevOps. 
I hope to add a solution to [this unanswered question](https://github.com/bregman-arie/devops-exercises/blob/master/exercises/shell/directories_comparison.md) in the form of a shell script:

`You are given two directories as arguments and the output should be any difference between the two directories`

As of today, the repo has 23.9k stars, and is actively managed by more than 80 contributors. Other students in our course have already opened a [PR in this repo](https://github.com/bregman-arie/devops-exercises/pull/229), so I hope to be able to do the same.
