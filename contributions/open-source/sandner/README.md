# Assignment Proposal

## Title

Contributing to Imgbot, friendly robot that optimizes images of your repository

## Names and KTH ID

- Leon Sandner (sandner@kth.se)

## Deadline

Deadline for task 3

## Category

Contribution to open-source

## Description
Imgbot crawls all your image files in GitHub and submits pull requests after applying a loss less compression. 
This will make the file size go down, but leave the dimensions and quality just as good. <br>
I want to dive into the topic of software bots, I never used this project but think it is very useful and I want to contribute to it. <br>
The repo has an active community and is big enough (883 stars)<br>
The issue is relevant and current, issue #1068 is also pinned by a community member. <br>
To resolve this issue, I will add a new feature that will convert the size of the images to the correct respective multi-byte notation.</br>
As I have not yet used this project before, the effort for me should be enough for me to pass this assignment.
