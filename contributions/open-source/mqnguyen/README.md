**Relevance**

This project is highly relevant to DevOps practices. By contributing Jenkins, a key CI/CD tool, to CasaOS, we're enhancing DevOps capabilities for home cloud users. The project employs containerization and Infrastructure as Code through Docker, mirroring real-world DevOps workflows. It involves version control, collaborative development, and documentation - all core DevOps principles. Making Jenkins easily accessible in a home cloud environment promotes DevOps practices at a personal level. This hands-on project not only applies DevOps methodologies but also expands the reach of essential DevOps tools, bridging the gap between professional and personal use of CI/CD technologies.
