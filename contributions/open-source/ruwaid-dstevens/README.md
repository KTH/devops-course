## Proposal
Create a new rule for Wemake Python Styleguide along with all of the required tests and get it approved by the maintainer.
GitHub Repo: https://github.com/wemake-services/wemake-python-styleguide

## Description
Wemake Python Styleguide strives to be the strictest linter ever. It has an active community in GitHub and is very popular. It is essentially a flake8 plugin making it very easy to use for anyone wanting to put themselves in agony.
