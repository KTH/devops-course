## Proposal
Create a new function for Visual Studo Code and push a PR to the repository- </br>
Issue: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/93300

## Description
Visual Studio Code is an open-source code editor which is incredibly popular today and very flexible. The function which is requested in the issue is that VS Code should open a newly cloned project when there is no other project open. Tight now a prompt pops up which should not even be there.

## Note
We changed repository because of complications with the previously approved one, see [#460](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/pull/460).
