## Proposal
Creating a SaltStack Slack bot. 

## Description
We want to create a Slack bot that will notify the user of the result of SaltStack's state runs. If time permits, perhaps allow sending commands from Slack as well. As of now, SaltStack has an API that allows for Slack integration, however, there seems to be no bots that make use of it. This implementation will be written in Python.
