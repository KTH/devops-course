## Description

There are a lot of untested classes in the open-source project [TheAlgorithms-java](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java). We are especially intrested in the mathematical algorithms in the project. When we quickly checked through all the classes, there were up to 30 classes that had no tests at all. We would like to write Junit test for an appropriate amount of classes.
