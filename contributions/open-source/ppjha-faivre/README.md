Contribution to open-source

## Description

We want to add a feature mentioned in this [issue](https://github.com/wearerequired/lint-action/issues/426). Currently, this action allows to set 
auto-fixing linting errors for all linters. There has been a requested feature to only allow auto-fixing for certain linters, which we want to
add ourselves. The repo has 329 :star: and 509 commits. The community is quite active. The issue was requested 7 days ago, and the author responded and 
labeled the issue with "help_wanted" 2 days ago. 

We believe this satisfies the requirements for the open-source contribution assignment as linting code on commits is an invaluabe feature in DevOps.
