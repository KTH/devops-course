### Description

[better-npm-audit](https://github.com/jeemok/better-npm-audit) is a repository for creating a more informative npm-audit output. This relates to DevOps because it is an improvement on an existing package manager and is used to make software development more efficient to debug and automates common development tasks. It also relates to DevOps because it makes it easier to understand dependencies vulnerabilities and possible security failures.

We have addressed an issue that was raised and requested to be implemented by the author of the library. We will create a feature that splits the output of better-npm-audit into 2 tables, separated as developer dependencies and production dependencies. This will help developers prioritize which packages to fix, since a developer vulnerability is generally not as problematic.

The issue that we will be addressing and our dialogue with the author are located at: [https://github.com/jeemok/better-npm-audit/issues/67](https://github.com/jeemok/better-npm-audit/issues/67).

The repository has 77 stars, 218 commits, and has an active community on GitHub since we recently had a conversation with the author.

Submission: 
The final pr can be found here: [https://github.com/jeemok/better-npm-audit/pull/78](https://github.com/jeemok/better-npm-audit/pull/78).

We have implemented the feature and passed all tests, including tests we modified to cover the new feature. We are currently awaiting approval from the author.
