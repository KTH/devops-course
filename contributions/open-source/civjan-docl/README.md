### Description

[better-npm-audit](https://github.com/jeemok/better-npm-audit) is a repository for creating a more informative npm-audit output. This relates to DevOps because it is an improvement on an existing package manager and is used to make software development more efficient to debug and automates common development tasks. It also relates to DevOps because it makes it easier to understand dependencie vulnerabilities and posible security failures.

We have addressed an issue that was raised and requested to be implemented by the author of the library. We will create a feature that splits the output of better-npm-audit into 2 tables, separated as developer dependencies and production devendencies. This will help developers prioritize which packages to fix, since a developer vulnurability is generally not as problematic.

The repository has 77 stars, 218 commits, and has an active community on GitHub since we recently had a conversation with the author.
