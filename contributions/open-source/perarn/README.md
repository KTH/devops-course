### Description
The [gosec](https://github.com/securego/gosec) repository hosts a neat program which analyzes Golang code for known security vulnerabilites.
It scans the GO AST to inspect the source code for issues.

As of writing this, the repo has 6.1k stars, 101 contributors, 759 commits and issues and PRs seem to come up quite frequently.

The reason for me choosing this repo is due to my [previous contribution](https://github.com/securego/gosec/commit/ea5d31f7f5cd942dbc4c9cdad74c2c1d1eab1ed2) to this project,
where I've had my contributions merged to the repo. I find security very interesting and
seeing how this would be part of DevSecOps, it made sense to me to pick this repo.

I went through the different issues posted and saw one that I thought was interesting, [link here](https://github.com/securego/gosec/issues/598). The issue describes a feature that some user would want to have implemented, where it is possible for the user
to write the log from checking source code to different files and different formats.
It had the labels "help-wanted" and "enhancement" so I figured I'd give it a go. There had been
prior discussion on how the feature should be implemented which I intend to follow.
