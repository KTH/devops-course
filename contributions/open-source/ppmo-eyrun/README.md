# Proposal
Setup a process for Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

# Description
Backstage is a DevOps UI tool used internally by Spotify, it gathers all their DevOps tools in one smooth interface and is used to manage those through automating DevOps processes.

They are now working on making it Open-Source and available to the developer community!

> Meet the first open-source developer portal that puts the developer experience first. With a unified frontend for all your infrastructure tooling, Backstage gets developers up and running faster, which makes them happier. And a happier developer is a more productive developer.


The issue we picked is https://github.com/spotify/backstage/issues/574

The issues get grabbed very quickly so we took this one before it was lost again.
