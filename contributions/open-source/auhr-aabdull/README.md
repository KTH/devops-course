### Description

[devops-exercises](https://github.com/bregman-arie/devops-exercises) contains questions and exercises on various technical topics, related to DevOps.

We found that there were no questions about software supply chain and dependecny management, two highly relevant fields of DevSecOps. Therefore, we want to contribute with questions related to the mentioned fields. Our aim is to read research papers and documentation related to the topics and then formulate relevant questions and answers for this open source repo.

As of today, the repo has 22.5k stars, and is actively managed by more than 80 contributors. We have had initial discussions with the owner of the repo who are welcoming our idea.
