## Topic

Increase documentation on an open source software that creates a bundle allowing someone to run Doctrine Migrations within an advisory lock.

## Solution

We have contacted the creators, and they have accepted our suggestion on increasing their documentation since it's almost non-existing at the moment. Our thought is for the documentation to be used by other developers, since the software is for developers using Doctrine.

We would like to add documentation sections for why to use the software (what difference it makes), how to implement the software, how to test the software and (if the creators want us to) how to contribute to the software. Our thought is to create this in the README.md connected to the software. 

The reason we chose this project is because it is a part of DevOps and software engineering that we don't know very much about, where the quality of the software when it's running is in focus, instead of the creation of the code. We haven't come across the concept of advisory locks before, so we think we will learn a lot during the creation of the documentation. We also think it's a good opportunity for us to practice reading another developer's code and understand this so well that you can write a documentation for it.
