## Description

ImgBot (#310) crawls through all of the image files in a GitHub repo and losslessly compresses them. Once it is done, it opens a PR for review and merging. The community is pretty active, it has 893 stars as well as over 1000 commits.

Support for conversion to WEBP format is a feature that is requested in this issue: https://github.com/imgbot/Imgbot/issues/1049

We intend to implement this feature, as well as update the documentation accordingly to properly explain how to enable / disable it.
