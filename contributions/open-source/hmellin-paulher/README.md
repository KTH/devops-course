## Topic
Zerocode introduction video

## Issue
We would like to contribute to an open-source project, namely https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode.


The project has an issue where they want a short video demonstration of Zerocode. 


We think this contribution would be appreciated as the issue is labeled as _help wanted_.
This contribution could also improve the documentation of the project in a way, as it will 
help new users get familiar to Zerocode. 

The issue can be found here:
https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode/issues/231

Since this Zerocode is about API automation and testing frameworks, 
we think this contribution falls under this topic:
https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/issues/9
