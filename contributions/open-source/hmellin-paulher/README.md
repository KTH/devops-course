Zerocode introduction video

## Issue
We would like to contribute to an open-source project, namely https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode.


The project has an issue where they want a short video demonstration of Zerocode. 


We think this contribution would be appreciated as the issue is labeled as _help wanted_.
This contribution could also improve the documentation of the project in a way, as it will 
help new users get familiar to Zerocode. 

The issue can be found here:
https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode/issues/231

Since this Zerocode is about API automation and testing frameworks, 
we think this contribution falls under this topic:
https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/issues/9

We received some guidelines on how we could improve our video for our task repetition. Here is that list and how we solved them.

* add intermediary slide frames to clearly see the separation of the 5 parts mentioned in the original issue.
We added 5 slides to clearly show the 5 parts.
 
* the background before zerocode at 2:07 should last at most 20 sec.
We decided to remove it and call it part 3 instead. It now shows the slide Part 3 for 5 seconds.
 
* Don't spend more than 2 seconds on a single sentence of bullet point
We made every bullet point 2 seconds long.
 
* Snippet at 0:10 should be bigger and explained
We got a larger snippet and added some explanatory text
 
* 2:23: avoid big pieces of text, 12 words maximum per bullet
We have ensured that every text/bullet point should be at a maximum of 12 words.
 
* all screen captures are too small, use larger fonts and better resolutions
After discussing with Long Zhang we have decided to zoom in on the screen capture, to let the user see clearly the important parts
 
* for all screen captures, add subtitles that clearly explains what happens
We added explanatory subtitles to the screen capture, where we explain what is going on.
 
* highlights important parts on screen where the viewer must focus
We used red boxes in and zooming in to highlight the important parts.
 
* add a take-home message slide, a credit slide
We added a take-home message and a credit slide at the end.
