Topic: Zerocode introduction video

We would like to contribute to an open-source project.
The project has an issue where they want a short video demonstration of Zerocode. 
We think this contriubtion would be much appreciated as the issue is labeled as _help wanted_.
This contributation could also way improve the documentation of the project, as it will 
help new users get familiar to Zerocode. 

The issue can be found here:
https://github.com/authorjapps/zerocode/issues/231

Since this repository is about API automation and testing frameworks, 
we think this contribution falls under this topic:
