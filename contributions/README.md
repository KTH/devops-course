## How to Register a Task

Make a pull-request based on the following steps:

- create a subfolder in a category folder, following the name convention: kthprofile1-kthprofile2
- in your folder, create a README.md file and put your topic information there (title, authors, category, relevance to Devops, originality)

TAs will review the PR. If it is accepted, you could begin your work on this topic, and make another pull-request later to submit your work.

See each category folder for per-category rules, eg https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/tree/2021/contributions/presentation
