Hi Kun Wu @Wkkkkk!

I will explain my thoughts on your essay section per section. After this a will provide a concrete list of possible changes. Finally, I will give some additional references to help with the mentioned corrections. I hope this will help you in some way.

**Summary**
I have read your essay and I think it is very well written. You have an interesting idea which the title represents. You discuss as your title defines very well thru the whole essay, which is really nice for me as the reader. The subject being explaining how software architecture has evolved over the years. There are some interesting sources for further readings as well. 

**Introduction**
Firstly, I would like to mention that your introduction is extremely well written. It really caught my interest in the subject. The only thing that I reacted to was the fact that it does not lead to what the essay is about. At least not to get the remarkable mark on the introduction. It does lead to the subject that there are different styles to design software, not on how they evolved over the years. An example of what I mean is that you mention a comparison of different architectures that is not clear in the rest of the essay.

**Discussion** 
I will call the next part of the essay the discussion. As a reader, I would like if there was a section that encapsulates the part where you explain the different designs. 

It is ambitious to explain as many software designs as you did in only 2000 words. In my personal opinion, I think it would have been easier to understand if you chose fewer designs and explained a bit more on each one. However, you do a great job of bringing a lot of pros and cons to each architecture, especially in sections 1 to 5. Towards the end, I felt like there was too much information crammed with too little explanation. 

As I  previously mentioned about the introduction, the same can be said for the rest of the essay. It is written in a really nice way. As I do not have a lot of knowledge about these techniques you discuss, I would like some more explanation at the beginning of each section. However, the essay is about the evolution of the architectures so perhaps this is redundant. 

A big positive for the report is the use of figures. They helped a lot when trying to understand the section.

**Conclusion**
You conclude nicely at the end of the essay. Although, I suggest having a separate section for this. Personally, I think it is easier for the reader if the takeaway is easy to find. 

**List of possible changes:**
* Add separate section/chapter for conclusion
* Add separate section/chapter for the information part. Eg. Discussion. And add section 2-7 as subsections
* Reformulate the first line in section 5.
* Change figure 7.2, hard to read the horizontal text. 
* In chapter 6. Start with a short introduction to what cloud services is before jumping in to talk about tools. (Just a line or two)
* Add a source in section 3. (See additional resources)
* Mention some more positives with all respective architectures. Especially in section 7.
* Copy the text into latex for a more professional look. (personal preference)
