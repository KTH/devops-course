## Done

Feedback:

> **Introduction:**
The introduction is clear and sets a solid foundation for the tutorial.  
**Typographical Errors:**
There are some typos that should be addressed for better clarity.  
**Understanding DevBox:**
The section on trying DevBox could be clearer. Specifically, is the devbox run py command intended to execute a script defined for installing dependencies?  
**Understanding the devbox.json File:**
This section is now clear and very insightful. I found it quite impressive!  
**Create Your Own Script - Part 1:**
This part was very helpful. I successfully created my own script independently, which greatly enhanced my understanding.  
**Create Your Own Script - Part 2:**
Should we also consider including the init hook in our script for completeness?  
**DevBox Integration with CI/CD:**
I appreciate the emphasis on maintaining consistency within the development environment.  
**Production Environment Considerations:**
How can we effectively transition DevBox into the production environment? Further guidance on this would be valuable.
