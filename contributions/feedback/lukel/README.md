## Description

I wish to give feedback on the Executable Tutorial submitted by Bassam Gamal and Abdelmoujib Megzari. I ran through
their tutorial and gained a lot of valuable knowledge about integrating static security analysis into a CI pipeline. I
would like to formally share this, as well as some points of constructive criticism, for my third task.
