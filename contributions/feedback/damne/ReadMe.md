# Feedback 

Thank you for this good essay on a really interesting topic! I have enjoyed reading it. I really learned a lot. The feedback is divided into the same sections as the essay and I have listed both strengths and improvements for each part. I hope these thoughts are constructive and helpful for your work. 

## General

- The essay is in pdf format.
- The title is good and informative. The questions it entails also seems appropriate for an essay of this length and size. 
- It is well structured into background, benefits and issues.
- It has a good introduction.
- It has a good conclusion.
- The essay is self-contained.
- It includes the minimum of 10 references.
- It is elegantly made in LaTex.
- It clearly has relevance to DevOps.

##  Introduction

**Strengths**

The introduction is well written and gives a good first view of what is meant by Infrastructure as code and what it includes. It clearly states the goal of Infrastructure as code as well as give some indication on how it is used. 

Another good aspect is how it shows the relevance of Infrastructure as Code from a DevOps point of view. That this is clearly stated early in the essay shows the reader the relevance of the topic and also puts the topic into context. 

I like how you bring up common tools and use that to bullet point the different parts of the process that Infrastructure as Code automates. 

The introduction also ends with a presentation on what comes next in the essay and what question the essay plans to answer. This gives the reader a good base as well as sparks interest. 

**Improvements**

In the last paragraph you mention that you want “to analyze the effects of using Infrastructure as Code”, effects on what? The work process? Work speed? Security? Think about specifying this since I believe you have done so in the rest of the essay, even if it’s not stated. 

## Background

**Strengths**

Good first paragraph. It shows the main problem for not working with infrastructure as code and gives the reader a good understanding of how the idea of infrastructure as code arose. 

**Improvements**

What is the purpose of bringing up the approach that the app team is on call for any issues? How does this relate to the subject? Either add a connection to Infrastructure as Code or remove this paragraph to keep the background relevant. 

## Benefits

**Strengths**

This is an information-packed part of your essay. Good job on getting it all together. I think that the information covers most of the aspects of infrastructure as code. It really gives the reader a crash course in what it would mean to implement infrastructure as code in a working process. It also shows that many benefits lead to other benefits. Mainly that reducing costs and time go hand in hand. 

**Improvements**

Since this part is packed with information it becomes rather hard to follow. I would recommend splitting the paragraphs into shorter ones to guide the reader on how to approach the text. Also, see my comments under Grammar and Spelling which I think can really help for this part. 

And as I will mention in more details under Issues, think about what tools you bring up as examples. Having the same examples throughout the essay, in all different parts, might give the reader better knowledge of what tools are used and how they work.

## Issues

**Strengths**

This part is very clear and easy to follow. It states various problems with Infrastructure as Code as well as conclude what these issues come from. Again, I think that you have managed to cover the most important issues organisations face when attempting to implement Infrastructure as Code. I also think that you have managed to state these issues in a clear way even though many of them are complex and depends on each other. 

**Improvements**

You bring up different tools for Infrastructure as code. It would be nice if these were mentioned under benefits as well. As of now, the reader has no knowledge of why one would choose to use any of these tools. Clearly, they must have a lot of benefits, which would be good to state as well. Also, it might be an idea to stick with the tools mentioned in the introduction to keep a red thread through the essay. I think bringing up the same tools in all parts would give the reader a better understanding of the tools and what they do, as well as their benefits and problems. 

## Conclusion

**Strengths**

The conclusion sums up the findings of the essay very well. It also connects back to the title of the essay and answers the question of the essay. 

## Grammar and Spelling

Throughout the essay, there is quite a lot of long sentences. Some changes tence mid-sentence, some are hard to follow and some might need clarification on what it is they refer back to (e.g instead of using “it is” write out what it actually is). 
For example the sentence: “It can also increase visibility to the state and configuration of the infrastructure for them and other users in the enterprise, which can be positive as they become more knowledgeable of it and can help to manage it or tailor the product to the infrastructure, and vice-versa”. Who are them? By users do you need other teams? I’m not saying one can’t understand what you mean (by piecing together from context) but it could really help the reader if you clarify some things. This could also reduce the risk of misunderstandings. 
I recommend using some tool to help you out. I really like Grammarly (https://www.grammarly.com/) but I’m sure there are others you can use as well. 

## Final thoughts

The essay is really interesting and has clear relevance for automation and DevOps. I believe that you have covered the importance of Infrastructure as Code and given a transparent overview of its pros and cons. 

What I liked most about the essay is how self-contained it is. You have found a perfect balance between explaining the concept and assumptions of previous knowledge. The essay gives the foundation of the topic and inspires further reading. Well done!
