# Feedback
## Strengths
* Well-placed figures and diagrams, helpful and relevant;
* Clear examples of network effects in sections 3.1 and 3.2;
* Good ways to introduce concepts (such as the spill-over and contamination effects) using examples of real scenarios;

## Weaknesses
* Some grammar needs fixing;
* The resolution for Figure 3 is a bit low;
* Slightly abrupt ending;

## Actionable improvements
* Regarding grammar, the second phrase of section 3.1 has a typo ("out") that can be fixed;
* Figure 3 can be replaced with an equivalent graph to illustrate the same point;
* Rather than letting 'carryover effects' be the last thing you mention, consider explaining it earlier. Either that, or just add another phrase to make the conclusion slightly smoother.

## Pointers
* For Figure 3, there are some slightly-higher resolution [alternatives](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/355318/images/Synthetic-Control-Graph.jpg);
* For improving the conclusion, there are [articles](https://writingcenter.unc.edu/tips-and-tools/conclusions/) that can provide some good examples.

## Overall
The essay provides good insight about A/B testing, giving examples of potential pitfalls, as well as how they are generally handled by different software companies. The word count fits the limit. Structurally, the essay is well-split among different sections, all of which bring relevant contributions to the main topic. There are 10 references, all pointing to good, relevant material. Overall, we liked the essay and enjoyed reading about the topic.

## Title
Title is accurate, specific, and effective in describing the scope of the essay. It is a little long, but that turned out necessary in order to accurately depict the topic at hand. 

## Introduction
The introduction provides a brief description of A/B testing as a practice. Its purpose is then elaborated with further examples, showing how it changed over time. Finally, the introduction ends with an overview of what is going to be discussed in more detail, which is a welcome addition. The section is neither too long or too short, and seems to include everything it needs to. Great work here.

## What is A/B Testing?
This section explains how A/B testing is done in practice. It starts by introducing the necessary terminology, and goes on to show an example. Formatting is consistent, figures are well-placed and relevant. 

## Network Effects
Description of the SUTVA and network effects. Well-written, overall. Maybe you could tie it to the previous section a bit more (the change of topic feels a bit sudden). Consider briefly mentioning it before, and then properly defining it in its own section (here) afterwards.

## Social Networks
This section shows good, relevant examples of network effects. The LinkedIn example was particularly interesting. It makes you wonder what other network effects can occur similarly without anyone noticing. We found it very useful for explaining the spill-over effect. Additionally, it was good pointing out that the GCP is not really a social network. Nevertheless, it is still similar to one so it was fine to include it in the same section, nonetheless. It was a great example of the contamination effect, too. Otherwise, the section is good.

## Online Marketplaces
This section shows how network effects are tackled by online marketplaces. The first subsection here is clear and relevant. The Ebay example is well-put. Ridesharing, however, is quite different from an online marketplace. Firstly, it is mostly based on trading a service, and secondly, the product is the same every time, just like you said. In this case, it probably deserves its own section, alongside social networks and online marketplaces. Anyway, the method used by Uber is also quite interesting. Good addition.

## Conclusions
Great conclusion. It sums everything up neatly. Also provides a bit of insight into other methods of how A/B testing can be done. Some previously-mentioned examples are referred to one last time. Re-calling information is useful for providing readers with better take-aways. The section is also just the right size. One slight issue here is mentioning carryover effects right at the end. It feels a bit unnatural introducing a new concept as the very last thing you say. Great content otherwise.
