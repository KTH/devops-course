## Structure of the feedback
 We decided early on to do the feedback separately in order to get different views of the paper.

## Feedback by Anders Renström
## Overall
Overall the essay is good, it has a clear red thread all throughout the paper with a self-containing structure.

#### Structure
The structure in the text was good, I liked that you provided almost the same amount of words for both monitoring tools and not prioritizing one monitoring tool over the other. It was also nice that the structure of the monitoring tool was the same (Introduction, product categories used, Advantages/Disadvantages, and Use cases). This made it easier to compare the two later on.

#### Linguistics
Overall, the linguistics of the text was good, it had a nice flow to it. Some minor inconsistencies with the capitalization of Splunk existed which is an easy fix.

## Feedback for sections
#### Abstract
The abstract has a nice summary of the whole essay which is what an abstract should do. However, due to the strict limit of the amounts of words in this essay. The words used here could maybe be used somewhere else to get more detail somewhere else of the paper.
###Introduction (What they aim to achieve should be mentioned in conclusion as well)
I think the introduction is great, it introduces the importance of continuous monitoring tools and that there are many different ones to choose between. The sentence "what they aim to achieve", clearly showcases that there currently isn't a one fit all monitoring tool.

One minor improvement would be to further clarify the reasoning behind choosing to compare the two monitoring tools. As was said at the beginning of the introduction, there are a lot of different monitoring tools. So what made you choose these too especially?

#### Background
Overall a good background, all subsections are fitting and interesting to read about. One thing that could be improved is to maybe shorten down the background for monitoring tools since the paper should focus a lot on comparing the two monitoring tools.

#### Monitoring Tools
I do like the monitoring tools part, it is well written, detailed, and an interesting read. However, it feels that the importance of the monitoring tools takes too many places for the paper as I mentioned above.

#### Splunk monitoring tool
Aside from minor capitalization problems with the word "Splunk" in this section, the section is constructed really well and each part seems relevant to the essay.

#### Some of the Splunk use cases
The use cases section seems a bit unclear, especially compared to the Nagios use cases. In this one, you only list examples while the Nagios section uses clear use cases.

#### Nagios monitoring tool
In the Nagios monitoring tool section, you mention that Nagios is free, however, there are actually some products such as the Nagios-Xi, that starts around 1995 $/per user to use. Please consider adding some sort of detail regarding what costs and what doesn't with the Nagios product line.

#### Some of the Nagios use cases
See Splunk use cases

#### Comparison
I really liked the comparison, dividing them to use cases, cost, and ease of use seemed clear after reading the background above.

- Use case: You mention that Splunk is the best monitoring tool for capturing and analyzing machine data, do you have any sources to back up this claim? Try to avoid using biased sentences.
- Cost: In terms of cost, I believe more factors could be considered aside from Splunk's traffic cost. Due to the minimal customer support system, customizable and lacking in the user-friendly GUI that Nagios has. There are risks that this sort of monitoring tool costs a lot to upkeep compared to Splunk's monitoring system.
- Ease of use: I wholeheartedly agree, that despite Splunk having a steep learning curve. With a highly customizable system like Nagios, more work is needed to be done. And if this work is documented thoroughly, it will be hard to maintain this code. Another thing the last sentence mentions that "Splunk is thereby easier to use thanks to its product support and documentation". I don't see this as one of the advantages mentioned above in the subsection "Splunk Monitoring Tool". Maybe include it to strengthen your claim
#### Conclusion
I'm not so sure about the conclusion, these systems do complement each other. But is it really worth it to combine the two tools? Or as you mentioned in "what they (the company) aim to achieve", do they want a highly customizable, free, and substantial user control monitoring tool like Nagios. Or do they want a Real-time performance, less hardware resource costly, real-time alert based for the desired search such as Splunk? I believe a more valid conclusion would be to say that it really based on what you as a customer need.

#### References
All references seem good, the only one that seems a bit unclear is the ITCS465-Nagios source. Maybe look at sources such as Capterra and TrustRadius to see what the user have to say about it.

## In General
The structure of the article is good, I can follow the structure of the article to read and understand the content of the article, and the abstract gave me a rough understanding of the text, to help me understand the main content of the article, which is very good. 
In addition, the content of the article is closely related to the title.

## Introduction
This part makes a good introduction to the topic, it briefly describes what continuous monitoring is and what the tools are generally used for. And also introduces the main content of each section of the article, which improves readability.
So I think this part is good and doesn’t need a lot of revision.

## Background
This section gives me a good idea of both of the tools mentioned in the title, both of their strengths and weaknesses, as well as where they are used. The content of this section is good, both tools have detailed background introduction. 
But I think this part is too much, from the length of this section will make me feel that the focus is on the introduction of the two rather than the comparison between them. And since there’s less about their use cases, I thought I’d cut the background on both tools and add more details of use cases. 
For example, in the section on Nagios use cases, there are detailed descriptions of the use cases, based on the references cited [16], and you can try to summarize them so that the reader can better understand what they are used for.

## Comparison
I think it makes sense to select three metrics for comparison, which are really elements to consider when choosing which monitoring tool to use.
But I think the comparison between the two tools is not just in terms of the metrics used to select the tool, but also in terms of their own characteristics. So I think you can also compare the differences from the monitoring features mentioned in the introduction to the monitoring tools in Section2.1 and the advantages and disadvantages of the two tools mentioned in Section2.2 and 2.4.

## Conclusion
The conclusion section summarizes the differences between the two by comparison. But there seems to be a lack of conclusions about use cases. This can be added after a description of the pros and cons of each tool. Splunk, for example, has advantages that make it a priority to use it in certain cases, and then you can talk about these use cases.

## References
As an essay, the number of references meets the requirements. References are presented well, clearly, and in the proper order. Both the reference in the article and the URL mentioned in the reference have clickable links, which I think is well done. Perhaps a little understated is the lack of references to academic journals or studies.

## Structure
I have some personal suggestions for the structure of the article. I think Section 2 is a bit long, and use cases about tools can not be part of the background section. Alternatively, you can merge the two sections (section 2.3 and Section 2.5) into a higher-level new section, such as Section 4, after section 3comparison.

In addition, if you want to modify the essay, you should pay attention to the word limit. I hope you can successfully complete the revision of the paper.
