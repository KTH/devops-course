## In General
The structure of the article is good, I can follow the structure of the article to read and understand the content of the article, and abstract gave me a rough understanding of the text, to help me understand the main content of the article, which is very good. 
In addition, the content of the article is closely related to the title.

## Introduction
This part makes a good introduction to the topic, it briefly describes what continuous monitoring is and what the tools are generally used for. And also introduces the main content of each section of the article, which improves readability.
So I think this part is good and doesn’t need a lot of revision.

## Background
This section gives me a good idea of both of the tools mentioned in the title, both of their strengths and weaknesses, as well as where they are used. The content of this section is good, both tools have detailed background introduction. 
But I think this part is too much, from the length of this section will make me feel that the focus is on the introduction of the two rather than the comparison between them. And since there’s less about their use cases, I thought I’d cut the background on both tools and add more details of use cases. 
For example, in the section on Nagios use cases, there are detailed descriptions of the use cases, based on the references cited [16] , and you can try to summarize them so that the reader can better understand what they are used for.

## Comparison
I think it makes sense to select three metrics for comparison, which are really elements to consider when choosing which monitoring tool to use.
But I think the comparison between the two tools is not just in terms of the metrics used to select the tool, but also in terms of their own characteristics. So I think you can also compare the differences from the monitoring features mentioned in the introduction to the monitoring tools in Section2.1 and the advantages and disadvantages of the two tools mentioned in Section2.2 and 2.4.

## Conclusion
The conclusion section summarizes the differences between the two by comparison. But there seems to be a lack of conclusions about use cases. This can be added after a description of the pros and cons of each tool. Splunk, for example, has advantages that make it a priority to use it in certain cases, and then you can talk about these use cases.

## References
As an essay, the number of references meets the requirements. References are presented well, clearly, and in the proper order. Both the reference in the article and the URL mentioned in the reference have clickable links, which I think is well done. Perhaps a little understated is the lack of references to academic journals or studies.

## Structure
I have some personal suggestions for the structure of the article. I think Section 2 is a bit long, and use cases about tools can not be part of the background section.Alternatively, you can merge the two sections (section 2.3 and Section 2.5) into a higher level new section, such as Section 4, after section 3comparison.

In addition, if you want to modify the essay, you should pay attention to the word limit. I hope you can successfully complete the revision of the paper.
