Essay written by: Fredrik Bj√∂rkman, Adam Henriksson

## Overall
Good grammar, good spelling and good structure of the essay. For the front page I would consider capitalizing every word of the essay, since we are writing an essay in English ("Agile Project Management with Jira" instead of "Agile project management with Jira"). A minor detail: this probably differs from person to person and what kind of essay it is, but front pages don't always have a page numbers, do they?
Figures should be referred to [[1]](https://guides.lib.monash.edu/citing-referencing/apa-tables-figures), otherwise there is no meaning in having them. You are currently only referring to figure 1 and 2. The rest (3, 4, 5, 6) you need to refer to or remove completely.
Nice conclusion in the end! Didn't look too much at your sources, but they look credible, nice that you had many.
I will now give feedback session by session.
## 1 Introduction
"We will not go into how to set up..." -> "we will not go into detail about how to set up..." is better phrasing I think.
Other than that I have nothing to point out.
## 2 Background
Perhaps you should refer to Figure 1 earlier in the text. Currently you are referring to it after you have talked about agile methods (end of page 3). I think it would be better to refer to figure 1 in the end of the first paragraph, and only refer to figure 2 in the end of the third paragraph.
Nice figures, good figure texts, as mentioned earlier, good that you refer to these figures.
Content is good.
## 3.1 What is Jira
Perhaps you should add: "That question we will answer in the following question" or something in those lines after the last question in this section.
## 3.2 Organize tasks, introducing Kanban
Nothing to say about this section, looks good!
## 3.3 Roadmaps
Change from "and the amount of sprints you have to achieve that goal" to "and the amount of sprints you NEED TO have to achieve...", alternatively "the amount of sprints you have to achieve that goal in", I think something is missing in that sentence.
## 3.4 Knowledge management with Confluence
I think you shouldn't write "our product" and "we need to follow". I would prefer "What are the formal requirements of the product and the regulations that needs to be followed". The former is more personal, like you're talking about a product you have, but these are instructions for any project. In the following points for example, you are doing it correctly: You are not writing "what did our team do well..." for example.
## 4 Conclusion
I think it is a good conclusion, it sums up what you have talked about in the essay in a nice way.
# Summary
I haven't heard about Jira before so it was nice to get to see a nice agile work tool you can use. The essay's content is good, the structure follows the typical essay format. Great job (:
