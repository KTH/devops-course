# REPEAT: Feedback on essay "Agile project management with Jira"

Essay written by: Fredrik Björkman, Adam Henriksson
Feedback provided by: [Axel Elmarsson](https://github.com/elmaxe) (<axelelm@kth.se>)

## Summary
I think the essay is good. Some things can be improved, see below. I think the content of the essay is interesting. What I am perhaps missing is some negative aspects of Jira, currently the essay talks a lot about positive aspects (which is not strange), but perhaps another view somewhere could be good. Something else that could be interseting is a comparison of Jira and other agile project management tools. Perhaps you could also talk about how and if you can integrate Jira with other software (CI and CD pipelines, Slack etc.).

## Strengths and weaknesses

**Strengths:**
- The topic of the essay is relevant to the course
- The background is great! It gives a great view from traditional engineering models (waterfall) to agile methods.
- Relevant figures
- Good grammar and structure. The essay is structured clearly!

**Weaknesses:**
- As mentioned above, the topic is relevant if you know your DevOps. However, it would be good if you added one or two sentences about why it is relevant for DevOps.
- All figures in an article should be referred to, you are not referring to all your figures.
- Grammar/structure needs fixing in a few places
- Throughout the essay, you use both paragraph spacing combined with paragraph indentation.

## Actionable improvements
- Figures should be referred to, otherwise there is no meaning in having them. You are currently only referring to figure 1 and 2. The rest (3, 4, 5, 6) you need to refer to somewhere in the text or remove completely.
- Title: For the front page I would consider capitalizing every word of the essay, since we are writing an essay in English ("Agile Project Management with Jira" instead of "Agile project management with Jira")
- Use either line indentation OR line spacing, not both at the same time. It looks very strange to combine the two.

## Pointers
- Figures should be referred to [[1]](https://guides.lib.monash.edu/citing-referencing/apa-tables-figures).


# Additional actionable improvements
Section by section
## 1 Introduction
**Suggestion #1**
Add these words:
> We will not go into **details about** how to set up and use specific features of Jira, ...

This is better phrasing.

## 2 Background

**Suggestion #2**
Perhaps you should refer to Figure 1 earlier in the text. Currently you are referring to it after you have talked about agile methods (end of page 3). I think it would be better to refer to figure 1 in the end of the first paragraph, and only refer to figure 2 in the end of the third paragraph.

**Suggestion #3**
Change from
> In modern software development where radical changes in the customer requirements may occur frequently, new innovative ideas may arise from competitors or other unexpected events may happen that need to be addressed, a need for flexibility and the ability to react quickly is essential for the development process.

to

> In modern software development where radical changes in the customer requirements may occur frequently, **new innovative ideas or other unexpected events may happen that need addressing. A** need for flexibility and the ability to react quickly is essential for the development process.

I think this sentence was too long

**Suggestion #4**
> Advantages that comes with a more iterative development strategy is that one can have continuous releases, which allows the customers to be more included in the development process and ~~will be able~~ **allows them** to give feedback based on the current deployment [3].

I think the use of `will` here sounds very strange.

**Suggestion #5**
> With short iterations and where all the team members in a team working **towards** the same goal

According to [[2]](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/toward-towards/), `towards` is the British way of saying `toward`. I suggest you change to `toward` since your essay is not written in British English.

## 3 The project management tool Jira
**Suggestion #6**
> In this chapter the project management tool Jira will be introduced and discussed ~~and~~ **as well as** the advantages of using a project management tool for agile project management.

Too many `and`. The last bi-sentence was not grammatically correct (`discussed` was not applied on it)

## 3.1 What is Jira
I feel like this section could be changed a bit. It doesn't need to be its own section, it could be integrated into the chapter meta text just above.

**Suggestion #7**
Move the second paragraph of `3.1` to `3`. Change `3.1` to only contain the paragraph about what Jira is (first paragraph of `3.1`). Remove the third paragraph of `3.1`, it could be placed in the beginning of section `3.2`. In other words, I'd say you should do like this:

> **3 The project management tool Jira**
In this chapter the project management tool Jira will be introduced and discussed and the advantages of using a project management tool for agile project
management. First **,** the features that help individual developers and small teams to organize their work and optimize their time will be shown. After that, the features that
help managers plan and organize important milestones, get actionable data,
achieve long-term goals, beat the competition and deliver value to customers
will be discussed.
**3.1 What is Jira?**
Jira is a project management tool developed by Atlassian and was originally
developed as a bug and issue tracker, but has today grown to be a powerful
management tool [11].

Why? The second paragraph of `3.1` is a meta text about the chapter, which should go under `3`.

## 3.2 Organize tasks, introducing Kanban

**Suggestion #8**
You are talking about problems in plural, not singular.
>  If you cannot see what problems exist, it’s hard to fix ~~it~~ **them**.

## 3.3 Roadmaps
**Suggestion #9**
> Knowing the overall goals of an ~~epic, and~~ **epic as well as** the amount of sprints you **need to** have to achieve that goal helps teams know both if they can finish their planned work on time, ...

## 3.4 Knowledge management with Confluence

I think you shouldn't write "our product" and "we need to follow". I would prefer "What are the formal requirements of the product and the regulations that needs to be followed". The former is more personal, like you're talking about a product you have, but these are instructions for any project. In the following points for example, you are doing it correctly: You are not writing "what did our team do well..." for example.

## 4 Conclusion

I think the content of the conclusion is good, it sums up what you have talked about in the essay, which makes the readers take remember more what they have just read. However the conclusion could perhaps be shortened down a bit.

# Final words
I think the essay describes agile methods very well. The authors talk about iterative development and sprints, team and task management, roadmaps and knowledge management. I don't have much negative to say about the content of the essay.
