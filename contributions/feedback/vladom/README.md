## Overall
In general, the essay is interesting and the structure is easy to follow. The topic is self-contained and clearly understandable by someone having minimum knowledge in computer science. You included enough reference from trustworthy sources. Overall you wrote a nice essay and I enjoyed reading it.

However, some points could be improved in order to have a better quality and make it more appealing.

## Strengths

Your **introduction** is very good, you are clearly explaining the problematic and how to solve it. In the same way for the **conclusion**, you summarize what you wrote before and also include the most important goals for the deployment.

The **structure** is good, we can easily understand and follow your explanation. I am just a bit confused by the title of the section 2 (see improvements). You are illustrating the different type of deployments with **figures**.

The topic chosen is really **relevant** for this course as the deployment is clearly a part of the DevOps life-cycle and your explanations are clear.

The essay is clearly **self-contained** and understandable by the target audience defined in the requirements.

You are using a LaTeX template, which makes you essay **elegant** and professional.


## Improvements

From my point of view, I think you could have a better **title**. You should use something catchy to get the attention of the potentials readers.

As said before, the **structure** is good but the title is a bit confusing in the section 2 (Types of deployment) because you have the subsections 2.1 (Deployment strategies) and 2.2 (Testing strategies). Is it normal that the testing is included in the types of deployment ? And what is the difference between 2 and 2.1 ? Not sure if I understood correctly, but I would change the name of the section 2.

Some of your sentences are very long like in the section 2.1.3 (Blue-Green). Half of your paragraph is in one sentence, I would try to simplify it and write shorter sentences to make it easier to follow.

After explaining the different types of deployment, I would summarize what you said. Just highlight the main points so the reader has a clear idea of the different types. Maybe you could add a comparison similar to [this picture](https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.thenewstack.io/media/2017/11/9e09392d-k8s_deployment_strategies.png).

When you are explaining the examples from the industry and the cost of outage, I would cite the source. You can add something like : According to *XXXX*, the blackout had a cost of ...

I noticed that you only wrote April 2021 for the date, I would add the **full date**.
