## Description

I would like to give feedback on the essay "Ethics of Canary Testing: Users as Guinea pigs" by Fredrik Svanholm (cf PR [#1870](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/pull/1870).
I think this raises very interesting issues, that are apparently not often discussed.
Further discussion and agreement of the feedback is given in the PR comment of the essay.
