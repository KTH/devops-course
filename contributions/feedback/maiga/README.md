## Description

I would like to test and give feedback in the tutorial for in Femto containers [PR #1720](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/pull/1720). I think it is a very exciting idea and I would love to see if I can use it in professional settings.
If the authors want it, I can test the tutorials at pre-submission. I also have hardware at home if there is some comparison to be done between containized version and testing on an actual board (the development board, the dongle and circuitplayground, so I am fully stocked in nRF52840).
