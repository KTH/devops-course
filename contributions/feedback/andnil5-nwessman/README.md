## Intro

I think the introduction page does a great job telling me the contents and the learning outcome of the tutorial. I also think it is a nice touch that it includes what pre-requisites that are needed to do the tutorial.

## Step 1

When explaining what is a meaningful test I think some parts could be explained clearer. Why, for example, is there a greater risk that I will not run a test if it is slow? I think this point clashes a bit with the section below *What are some test strategies?* that tells us that UI tests are *Slow & Expensive*. Does that mean that UI tests are not meaningful?

I would have liked to see an explanation on what a "flaky test" mean. If we are at the level of explaining what a meaningful test is then I do not think "stable/flaky test" is common knowledge. You also use abbreviations for three different tests strategies instead of writing out their full names. You do not have to explain them more in depth, but at least give me the full names for some more context and make it easier for me to look them up at a later time (for example "STEP test strategy" does not directly give me that specific strategy).

Overall I think this section could benefit from using the pyramid picture as a take-off point and then explain the different types of tests for each layer and the cost/time trade-off for each different type of testing.
