## Overview
First of all, it was a very well written Essay! For easier usage, I will denote “End-to-End testing” as “E2E testing” throughout this feedback.

The essay clearly explains the basic nuances of E2E testing and how it is effective in the software development life cycle when implemented right? As you have written this essay from your experience, it has become more authentic. Even though the essay touches upon different areas such as E2E testing, tools, approaches, advantages/disadvantages, I felt it could have been more in depth in one of the particular areas of your choice instead of focussing everything on a high level. Otherwise, I really enjoyed reading the essay and there were very less number of typo’s or misspelled words. Good work! 


## Possible improvements

### 1. Introduction

This section offers a nice insight of what E2E testing is and the places it could be used. It would have added more clarity, if you had mentioned in the title that the essay focuses on the E2E testing in automated environment. You could have still covered areas on Manual E2E testing by denoting it appropriately inside the essay.


### 2. E2E Testing 

I expected this topic to be an introduction to E2E testing instead of one particular example. I liked your idea of explaining the theory by an example. But for a person from a different background, it would been useful if E2E testing is justified more and how it has been implemented differently in Manual & Automated environments. Some more basic components of E2E testing could have also been mentioned in this topic instead of using the ones relevant to the example.


### 2.1.	Snapshot Testing

As I mentioned above, the essay now started traveling on the same example which sets the tone on the reader.  It is understandable that Snapshot testing is more applicable in web applications citing dependencies, you could have still used different examples. If you had used different examples, it would add value and trust in the reader that it actually is an interesting cross-functional utility. 


### 2.2. E2E Testing Approaches

This topic could have been a totally separate topic instead of a subset. It is really interesting to see how the approaches evolved over time especially the latest AI-based tools. {Thanks for instilling the interest :) }


### 3. Advantages and Disadvantages

I like the way you started this topic because it gives the reader, a clear image of how difficult it is to implement E2E tests and justified the need for automated environment. I agree that it is time consuming to start/close the application while performing E2E tests. But it also gives the wrong idea that E2E testing is optimal only in automated environment. You could have added some theories to prove it is also a successful solution in Manual environment. 


### 4. When to use E2E Testing

This topic clearly covers the essential as when to use the E2E testing. The pyramid simply explains the need for E2E and how it can be designed according to the needs/resources in the provided environment. I agree to the final line, that the project should consider their scale before implementing the E2E tests. You don’t want to end up spending so many resources into E2E testing when you know it doesn’t require much. 


### 5. Conclusion

After a fun reading, the essay reaches a point where it suggests possible implementation of E2E testing across domains. Clear suggestions and neatly concluded.!  

Thanks for the essay!
