An Introduction to the two Most Popular Container Orchestration Platforms: Docker Swarm & K8s

Docker Swarm and K8s are the most popular orchestration platforms today, and we believe the reader deserves to get a complete introduction to both platforms in one essay. We will also compare how both platforms manage containers.

This essay intends to introduce both platforms in more detail and compare how they manage containers, while the sources found give a shorter introduction and don't put much focus on the differences in management of containers.
