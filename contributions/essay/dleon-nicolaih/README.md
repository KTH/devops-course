## Description
An Introduction to two Popular ContainerOrchestration Platforms Docker Swarm & K8s

Docker Swarm and K8s are two of the most popular orchestration platforms today, and we believe the reader deserves to get a complete introduction to both platforms in one essay. We will also compare how both platforms manage containers.

## Criteria we want to fulfill
Here is a list of the criteria we want to fulfill:

* title: The essay has a good title

* introduction: the concept "container" is used before being introduced (sec 2.1). Give an overall background introduction in the beginning: why the use of containers is increasing? what benefits developers will get? what challenges it brings to developers? why container orchestration is important? what is the relation between container orchestration and DevOps? -> The concept of container has been added to the introduction.

* self-contained: The essay is self-contained

* well-structured: replace section 2 (Main Concepts) with a Background section, where you introduce the necessary knowledge that readers need to know before going to docker swarm and k8s. Concepts could be one of the subsections in section 2. Docker and  a general introduction to orchestration can be put in this section as well. -> The main concepts section has been replaced by a background section and a generatl introduction of orchestration has been added.


* conclusion: "Both K8s and Docker Swarm provide similar services but with slightly different approaches". The sentence is too vague. Try to be as precise as possible. Recap the 2-3 main points of the essay. -> The conclusion is no longer vague and recaps the main points of the essay.


* figures: Avoid using something like "An image of ... can be seen below". Explicitly refer them and give explanations in text. -> The figures has ben explicitly references and an explanation is given in the text.


* references: provide title and date along the url in the list of references -> Title and date has been added to the list of references.


* elegant: We think that the essay should pass the elegant criteria because it is visually appealing and it uses LaTeX.


* sound: We also think that the essay should pass the sound critiera because the essay is factual an accurate.

* relevant: The essay addresses a topic that is relevant for DevOps
