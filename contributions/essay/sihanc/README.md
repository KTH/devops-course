## Proposal
I want to write an essay about the feature store in MLOps. Feature Store plays an indispensable role in MLOps because it is believed to conveniently store, update, search and share Machine Learning features that can be used for training and reasoning. Many big companies are currently working on it. However, there is no dominant application in the market.

This essay will include following aspects:

* Why feature store is important? How it can be used to help developers do ML jobs?
* How to deploy and use a feature store in CI/CD pipelines
* What are the main solutions & comparisons of big companies when implementing and providing a feature store
* Outlook on the future role feature store will play in MLOps
