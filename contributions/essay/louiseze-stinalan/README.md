## Topic
Code coverage.

Code coverage is a way to see how much of the code that is covered when the tests run. By having a high code coverage your program has a lower risk of having undetected bugs. We would like to write an essay on the background to code coverage and the different ways of using this when developing softwares.

## Structure
- What is code coverage?
- How is this correlated to the amount of bugs in your code/what does science say about code coverage?
- How can a developer use the concept of code covering when developing software?
- Are there any tools to help with code covering?
- Conclusions
