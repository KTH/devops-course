## What we have done according to feedback

Thanks a lot for the feedback from @charlottea98. Quick feedback within 24 hours and really good suggestions.

- Section 1 : introduce the concept of shrinking and generator in the first paragraph
- Section 1 : change the last paragraph according to the suggestion because it is not in an understandable manner
- Section 2 : change the section title from "What is property-based testing" to "property-based testing"
- Section 2 : clarify the first sentence
- Section 2 : add a few words to explain how the problems in different categories are detected. Since we are writing a brief introduction, we think it would be too much to go into concrete examples of how the problems are found.
- Section 2.1 : delete "As known to all"
- Section 2.2 : clarify the idea of combining basic generators using a small example.
- Section 2.3 : state the fault implementation before showing the figure
- Section 3 : change "boring" to "tedious" and "time consuming" 
- Section 4 : clarify the sentence of QuickCheck and QuviQ
- Section 4 : clarify the last paragraph "Developers should choose tools based on their own situations"
- Section 5 : rewrite the sentence "If there are a lot of possible combinations of inputs..."
- Section 5 : add "or not" in the last sentence
- Section 5 and 6 : move the statement of future work to the discussion seciton
- Section 6 : add the last sentence to summarize
- delete unnecessary sentences and one unnecessary reference
