### Proposal:

An essay about how A/B testing is performed by companies with large user bases. The following are some points we might touch on:

- Theoretical: What is A/B testing? Mostly on a conceptual level but might include some statistics if it's appropriate
- Technical: What tools are used in A/B testing and how are they orchestrated?
- Impact: What problems is A/B testing used for and what effect does it have?
- We might also explore some of the differences in the approaches used by different companies.

We will base our essay on the large number of articles, papers and blogs where companies describe how they perform A/B testing. Some examples below:
