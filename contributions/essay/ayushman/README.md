## Description

In this essay I would like to explore service mesh layers and how they fit into the Kubernetes architecture. I will begin by giving a brief overview of what is a service mesh, what they do, how they implement communication, observability, security, and reliability in their layers. I will explore a little bit about how Linkerd implements a service mesh and the Linkerd control and data plane. Then I will wrap up with some reflection on what are the advantages and disadvantages of using service mesh and Linkerd as one of the solutions.
