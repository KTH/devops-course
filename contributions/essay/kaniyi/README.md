## Proposal
I would like to write an essay that could act as a guide to master students who want to start
working with container orchestration tools. Hence, the interesting points of comparison would be: Ease of installation, 
learning curve, scalability and monitoring system for the clusters.

## Relevance
Container orchestration tools somewhat represents the essence of DevOps; automating as much as possible. With large-scale 
projects that includes container technology, we want to be able to add, remove, update containers without having to manually
do this when there exists as much as thousands of nodes.
