## Relevance

Git is a tool that is used in almost all software projects and is thus very relevant to DevOps. Usability of tools is also relevant to the workflow, which is integral to the DevOps process.

## Innovativity/ Originality

This essay will, in contrast with other Git essays and presentations, have its focus on the usability of Git and the architecture and system behind it. It will dig deeper into what makes Git so unfriendly for new users and also propose solutions for the future.
