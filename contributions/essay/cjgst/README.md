## Relevance

Git is a tool that is used in almost all software projects and is thus very relevant to DevOps. Usability of tools is also relevant to the workflow, which is integral to the DevOps process.

## Innovativity/ Originality

This essay will, in contrast with other Git essays and presentations, have its focus on the usability of Git and the architecture and system behind it. It will dig deeper into what makes Git so unfriendly for new users and also propose solutions for the future.

## Outline

The essay will begin by presenting the principles behind Git and why new users may find them hard. It will discuss the model behind Git, the decentralized approach with local Git and Git servers and why it may be unintuitive. A section with my experience in relation to the material I present in the beginning. I will then discuss how to learn Git and how to tackle the obstacles presented to be able to properly master it.
