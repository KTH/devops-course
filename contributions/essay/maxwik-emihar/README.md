**Relevance**

In the topic of Devops, DevSecOps has emerged, short for; development, security and operations. DevSecOps has emerged to include security as a part of the development cycle. However, as the importance of security in development has been growing, a new development process has emerged, with even more emphasis on security: SecDevOps. With security playing a big role for the subject of Devops, we wish to examine the more niche development process of SecDevOps and compare it to the more well known DevSecOps.
