# Change Log
Went through the essay again and fixed typos and replaced informal sentences. 

## Section 1: Introduction
Added clear problem statements and references about DevOps and security. 

Moved the "shift left" term to section 2.

## Section 2: DevOps VS DevSecOps
Shortened the introduction about the traditional software development model and some basic introduction about DevOps to focus more on the security side. 

Key concepts were defined and motivated.

### 2.2 DevSecOps

Replaced the table with a newer one.

## Section 3: Integrating security into DevOps

Rewrote this section while basically maintaining its original structure. 

Added more references to back our claims and avoided unnecessary strong claims. We also made a clearer motivation for why we introduce security tools. These tools provided instantiations to our introduction of SAST and DAST tools.

## Section 4: Discussion - Future trends of DevSecOps

This section was also almost completely rewritten. We cited papers and tools to support our discussion about the application of AI in DevSecOps

## Section 5: Conclusion

Rewrote this section to make it more concise. The takeaway now has been backed by our previous discussion.
