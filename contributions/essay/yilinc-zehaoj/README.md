## Description

 With DevOps approaches and methodologies, new features in products can be delivered more easily, rapidly and in an incremental way. It suits the need of today's development work and offers tremendous business benefits. However, as this set of practices being adopted more often, ensuring the security of applications becomes more critical. That's when DevSecOps is brought up.

Our essay aims to give a brief introduction to DevSecOps. We want to first talk about the security challenges faced by DevOps (why DevSecOps is needed). Then talk about DevSecOps tools and practices, and how they solve the problems. Finally, we would discuss the limitations of current DevSecOps methods and ways to solve them.
