## Description
Amazon Web Services has become one of the staples of any modern platform development. It would be interesting to take a deeper look into how AWS may influence use of DevOps practices, even if it is not obvious on the surface.

The focus will be on:
- Benefits of AWS compared to a clasically deployed server setup
- What development approaches AWS encourages
- Draw a parallel between these AWS approaches and the core ideas of DevOps development
- Give concrete examples of what AWS services correspond to what DevOps practices


## References
Some of the key references that we are going to use in the essay:
- https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/ - Amazon's own vision of DevOps practices. This article may give a small introduction on DevOps, but it is extreme surface knowledge that is rather business oriented.
- https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.focus.lib.kth.se/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7458761 - DevOps by Christof Ebert, this article talks about the main DevOps tools and techniques.

There can be found many more resources talking about DevOps in general, but the missing link between them is the explanation of concrete reflection of DevOps in AWS services. A quick concrete example of this could be AWS Lambda (a serverless function provider service) and AWS Cloud9 (cloud based IDE) and how they allow to develop/debug a serverless cloud application locally on your machine.
