# Essay Proposal 
I want to write an essay about why to (and how to) use BDD(Behaviour Driven development) in DevOps.
The essay will cover:
- DevOps testing (The testing hourglass)
- What BDD is (short on how it evolved)
- How BDD can improve devOps projects 
- The 3 amigos (who should use BDD)
- BDD tools and practices to use and follow
