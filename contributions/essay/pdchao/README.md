## Description

To understand Docker containers, it is vital to understand how the container lifecycle works and the different stages a container can be in. In this essay I will walk through the container lifecycle explaining each step separately detailing how a container falls into the state and the attributes attached to each stage. I will also note the common misconceptions like the difference between pause and stop, and rm and kill.
