## Description

Subject: DevSecOps SOA dependency check methods, and exemplify with a tool like Snyk. 

Why: In our exploratory work, dependency checking appeared like a major challenge as much open sources and proprietary software is built on dependencies. Problems can occur because of bloated dependencies, politically motivated sabotage and of course criminally motivated gain. 
In the essay, we will also present a general overview of DevSecOps, challenges and good practices.
