## Description

We plan to write an essay that embodies the core of DevOps culture and analyze how the transition to a DevOps culture is made. We plan to go into detail on what can improve as well as what challenges can arise. We are very interested in the human and psychological perspective of DevOps since we believe itâ€™s necessary to get the full picture of what DevOps is.

- What is DevOps culture?
- What does the transition to a DevOps culture look like?
- What challenges and benefits can arise?
