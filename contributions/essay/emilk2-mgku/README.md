## Description

Using machine learning to detect security vulnerabilities in software is a new method of finding
vulnerabilities. With increasing complexity of software, it is becoming harder to find vulnerabilities, where traditional methods of testing might not longer be sufficient. This essay will explore what options exists in terms of machine learning powered vulnerability detection, and how it can be used in a devops pipeline.

**Relevance**

This topic is relevant since it covers a new method of testing software for vulnerabilities, which could become part of a devops pipeline.
