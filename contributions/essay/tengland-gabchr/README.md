## Description

MLOps is quickly asserting itself as an important practice to consult when designing and maintaining large ML systems. Our aim is to explore the opportunities that MLOps principles may offer while also providing a state-of-the-art discussion on the existing challenges, mainly focusing on pipelines, triggers and feedback loops.  

**Relevance**

ML systems are become more relevant each day and are increasing dramatically in size. As these systems grow developers are likely obligated to follow DevOps principles to ensure continued scalability and maintainability. As such, MLOps is an area that will likely grow in relevance, both from an academic and industrial perspective.
