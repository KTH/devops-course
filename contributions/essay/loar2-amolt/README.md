There are several security aspects of DevOps that researchers and developers are actively trying to address. The more widespread DevOps gets, the more data is being gathered and the more data is being gathered, the more privacy concerns arise.

As such, this essay will focus on one of the main security concerns of DevOps: privacy. We will give a brief overview of general security issues within DevOps, then we will zoom in more closely on privacy and GDPR issues. Finally, we will offer some solutions and reflect upon the purpose of privacy in DevOps and how it is being maintained at the moment.

**Relevance**

Security and privacy are concepts that affect every facet of technology. GDPR especially must be followed by any organization that processes private data. Seeing as many organizations are using DevOps in their software engineering process, privacy is an integral part of DevOps.
