## Description

GitOps is a development technique which evolved from DevOps and is quickly gaining traction among developers. The technique has been defined by WeaveWorks and seeks to employ a strict structure of infrastructure as code (IaC) strictly within the framework of git. We want to introduce GitOps, its approach to infrastructure as code, and its relation to DevOps as a whole.

**Relevance**

GitOps can be considered a subset of, or an evolution of, DevOps, and carries on the use of the practices that have become standard within the field. To explore GitOps can shine a critical light on the orthodoxy of DevOps, and perhaps and the future of it.
