## Description

In an era of data-driven decision making, machine learning (ML) has become an essential tool for businesses to gain insights and make informed decisions. As the field of ML continues to grow, so does the need for more efficient and reliable ways to develop and deploy ML models. One such approach is to incorporate continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) into the ML pipeline, creating an automated and streamlined workflow that accelerates model development, testing, and deployment.

Airflow is an open-source platform for orchestrating data workflows using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs). It can be used to create a ML pipeline by defining the tasks in the DAG which can be defined using custom operators or built-in Airflow operators. Gitlab's built-in CI/CD functionality is a tool that can automate the process of building, testing, and deploying software applications by triggering pipeline executions based on event driven mechanisms such as code pushes or merge requests. In this essay, we will explore how integrating Apache Airflow and GitLab CI/CD can leverage the benefits of both tools and provides us a way to create a fully automated ML pipeline that incorporates CI/CD. 
 
**Relevance**

CI/CD is a key practice in DevOps and MLOps.
