## Description

In an era of data-driven decision making, machine learning (ML) has become an essential tool for businesses to gain insights and make informed decisions. 
As the field of ML continues to grow, so does the need for more efficient and reliable ways to develop and deploy ML models. 
One such approach is to incorporate continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) into the ML pipeline, creating an automated and streamlined
workflow that accelerates model development, testing, and deployment.

This essay will discuss the process of setting up an automated ML pipeline that includes CI/CD 
and also explore the tools required to setup each stage of the pipeline (data ingestion, training, evaluation and deployment).

**Relevance**

CI/CD is a key practice in DevOps and MLOpss.
