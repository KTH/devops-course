[Essay submission](https://github.com/haraldhob/devops-course/blob/essay/contributions/essay/hhob-jaldu/DevOps_Essay.pdf)

We would like to write an essay about the similarities and differences of snyk and dependabot. We will cover what these tools are and their aim. Further, we would like to analyse how these tools can be integrated into a development cycle.

**Relevance**

Softwarebots are mentioned in the last week of the lecture and may help organisations to move to a more DevOps based development cycle by automating and helping at certain tasks.
