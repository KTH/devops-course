## Description
In traditional DevOps, security concerns are addressed at the end of the development pipeline, but this can sometimes be insufficient. DevSecOps has emerged as an approach that incorporates security into the development cycle. Will DevSecOps be the next big step with the increasing need for security? In my essay I aim to cover what DevOps is, what DevSecOps is, the differences between them, as well as what the benefits and drawbacks are for each and compare them.
