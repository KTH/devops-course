## Description

In 2010, Netflix engineers released a random wreaking havoc onto their systems that would come to revolutionize testing - the Chaos Monkey. The idea was to randomly disable production instances, i.e create chaos, to expose weaknesses in the system. These flaws could then be eliminated by improved recovery mechanisms and the system would come out stronger. This chaotic monkey has gone through multiple iterations and has led the way to one of the biggest and most relevant trends of DevOps in 2023 - Chaos Engineering.

In this essay, I will go through the principles of chaos engineering, as well as its benefits and drawbacks. Furthermore, I will describe the journey from the pioneering Chaos Monkey to the established Chaos Engineering principles and tools that are widely used today. 

**Relevance**

Chaos engineering is a relevant and growing field in DevOps. It is a very useful tool that can be used to expose and identify weaknesses and to create resilient and robust systems. Chaos engineering definitely has an exciting future within DevOps and it would be interesting to investigate the history that has led it to this point.
