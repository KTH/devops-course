In 2010, Netflix engineers released a random wreaking havoc onto their systems that would come to revolutionize testing - the Chaos Monkey. The idea was to randomly disable production instances, i.e create chaos, to expose weaknesses in the system. These flaws could then be eliminated by improved recovery mechanisms and the system would come out stronger. This chaotic monkey hass gone through multiple iterations and has led the way to one of the biggest and most relevant trends of DevOps in 2023 - Chaos Engineering.

In this essay, I will go through the principles of chaos engineering, as well as its benefits and drawbacks. Furthermore, I will describe the journey from the pioneering Chaos Monkey to the established Chaos Engineering principles and tools that are widely used today. 

**Relevance**

Chaos engineering is a relevant and growing field in DevOps. It is a very useful tool that can be used to expose and identify weaknesses and to create resilient and robust systems. Chaos engineering definitely has an exciting future within DevOps and it would be interesting to investigate the history that has led it to this point.

**Revisions**

* Problem

  Added a paragraph to section *1. Introduction*, clearly describing the problem that Chaos Engineering tackles and why it is important to DevOps.

* Sound

  Rephrased and added references to two sentences in section *1. Introduction* and *3.4. Tools and Platforms*.

* Figures

  Added references to the figures, and edited figure 1 to contain more information.

* Reflection/conclusion

  Added a paragraph to section *5. Reflection and Conclusions* that further reflects upon the importance of Chaos Engineering and its relevence to DevOps. Due to the word limit, I was not able to add a paragraph with suggestions for future areas where Chaos Engineering can be applied.

* Word limit

  Made section *2. Modern Chaos Engineering*, *4.1 Security Chaos Engineering* and *2.1 Chaos Monkey* shorter to stay within the word limit after the mentioned changes.
