## Topic
Different ways of improving DevOps with Machine learning.

My proposal is to write an essay on how you could use machine learning to improve DevOps. 
I did some research and couldn't find so many solutions related to devops. I therefore propose an essay about gathering ideas on how machine learning can improve this area.

Examples:

* Pattern recognition in server logs, to recognise anomalies etc.
* Predicting server failure
* Find more applications of machine learning related to devops.

When I have discovered the areas that could be improved by machine learning, I want to discuss which machine learning method/methods is suitable to solve the problem/problems.

I appreciate any kind of feedback about this essay proposal.
