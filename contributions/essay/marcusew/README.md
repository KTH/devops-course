# Feedback
The essay has been updated with the given feedback in mind. The changes where rather large, but the general idea is to get a better structure and technical depths to the essay. Bellow is the changes presented.

* The essay got a new title that is more connected to the content of the essay, which is improving the workflow of DevOps.
* Chapter 2 has been removed because it was irrelevant for the essay and replaced with a longer introduction and more content related to DevOps.
* The suggested model is presented in chapter 2 instead of chapter 4 as suggested by the TA, and more details surrounding each component of the model has been added. The previous chapter 3 has been merged into chapter 2.
* The log filtering technique has been elaborated and refers to different papers.
* All Wikipedia references except 1 has been remove. Approximately 12 conference papers have been added. The Wikipedia link that was kept is a reference to where I got one of the images.
* The applicability chapter has been extended with more information about log filtering and the used methods has been added.
* Several spelling mistakes have been fixed.

The previous passed criteria where: introduction, conclusion, figures, elegant and relevant.

With this version I aim to pass: introduction, conclusion, figures, elegant, relevant, title, well-structured, self-contained, references, sound.

# Initial proposal

## Topic
Different ways of improving DevOps with Machine learning.

My proposal is to write an essay on how you could use machine learning to improve DevOps. 
I did some research and couldn't find so many solutions related to devops. I therefore propose an essay about gathering ideas on how machine learning can improve this area.

Examples:

* Pattern recognition in server logs, to recognise anomalies etc.
* Predicting application/server failure
* Optimising software testing with machine learning.

When I have discovered the areas that could be improved by machine learning, I want to discuss which machine learning method/methods is suitable to solve the problem/problems.

## Preliminary structure

* Introduction
* What is ML, (also present relevant methods)
* Areas in DevOps that could be improved by ML (A lot of references to earlier/similar works)
    * Software failure detection (different kinds of failure detection)
    * Anomaly detection (Security)
    * Software testing 
* Are these ides applicable for a company, can they be combined.
* Suggestions(My own) on ML methods that could be explored in order to improve the areas.
* Conclusion

## Whats unique about this essay
The main idea behind this essay is to highlight different ML methods to improve DevOps. I will reflect over the found methods if
they are applicable in a company to improve DevOps and if they can be combined with other methods to automate several areas regarding DevOps.
I will also summarise and compare the different ML methods in order to improve the readers understanding about the different methods.

Here are some references that I plan to use in the essay:

    anomalies can be detected by different ML techniques.

    * The author summarises some ways machine learning could be used for software testing. This source will be used as a foundation
    for my reasoning about applying machine learning to software testing.
 

I appreciate any kind of feedback about this essay proposal.
