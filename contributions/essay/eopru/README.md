## Description

Scalability testing is performed to check how well an application scales up or down as a reaction to an increase or decrease
in usage. There are multiple aspects that can be tested, for example, response time, network usage, CPU usage, and more.
One of the primary purposes of scalability testing is finding the limit, how far can you push it until it stops and what is the
reason for it stopping.

**Relevance**

Scalability testing gives a development team an idea of how well the system responds to scaling, giving a better overview
and insight into how the application responds to scaling and can perhaps lead to the discovery of weaknesses.
It can be added to the CI/CD pipeline of the project to be a part of the test automation process.
Being aware of how your system handles scaling is important since poor scalability can for example affect the user's 
experience of using your product or make your product use more resources than it needs leading to an increase in budget.
