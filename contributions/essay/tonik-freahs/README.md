## Description

Legacy systems are notorious for being tightly coupled to their environments, and it is often difficult to make changes without breaking stuff. In this essay we want to highlight some methods that we could use to introduce modern development practices to such systems to make them more manageable. All this should be done with DevOps tools and methodologies, and without having to rewrite the entire codebase.
