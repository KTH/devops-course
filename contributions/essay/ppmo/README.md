# Proposal
An Essay exploring SCA tools and automatically generated fixes

I want to learn more about Static Code Analysis and the tools supporting automatic fixes to bugs which will be the topic of the essay. In the background diving into how SCA usually works and then moving on to some approaches for automatically fixing bugs and then mentioning some State-of-Art.
