## Description

Nowadays, CI/CD pipelines can be defined by exploiting several tools. Each tool has its grammar and capabilities.
Usually, such tools require the definition of ad-hoc configuration files (YAML files) with specific keywords and values.
The complexity resides in the definition of such configuration, which is time-consuming and hard to debug.
Visual tools should simplify the definition of the overall configuration.

In conclusion, I would also like to propose some ideas. These could represent future aspects to develop to improve CI/CD definition, regardless of the tool.
