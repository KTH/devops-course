## Description

[Essay](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/pull/contributions/essay/felixq/DevOps_Essay.pdf)

I will explore the shift-left approach in DevOps and try to answer several practical questions about the concept. What is it? How can you implement this method in an existing business? What if you start a new company? Many of its upsides are quite obvious such as speeding up the CI/CD pipeline, but are the potential pit-falls you could avoid and what are the drawbacks overall of this mindset?

**Relevance**

Modern companies and startups where many of us will end up working most likely uses this approach in to some degree. It would be good to know what the alternative is (i.e. how would it work if we did not use this approach) and how it can be implemented effectively to not only speed up the CI/CD pipeline but also create a healthy work environment, mainly for the developers.
