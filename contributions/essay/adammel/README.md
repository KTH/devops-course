## Description
As video games become larger and more complex, ensuring thorough testing can be challenging. Relying solely on human testers can slow down development. To speed up the process, autonomous agents using reinforcement learning have shown promise in exploring and testing game scenarios. This goes for both single player environments and multiplayer environments, although the latter would require multiple agents as well. For my essay I want to explore the current techniques being used and discuss how effective they seem to be. So far I have two research papers that I would base this essay upon, one from OpenAI (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.07528.pdf) and one from EA (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.13798.pdf). 

Relevance

As testing is a core component in devops, automated testing could be a massive improvement in terms of thoroughness and efficiency. Tools like Agent testing could potentially save a lot of time in game development pipelines and decrease the risk of letting bugs out in the production environment.
