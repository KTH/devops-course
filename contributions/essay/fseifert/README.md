### Description

The proposal can be found under the [PR #933](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/tree/2021/contributions/essay/fseifert). 

I did not describe the implementation details for the required security services. However, a table clearly states which 
security services are needed, which security requirement they address and which MSA layer they deal with.

I am waiting for feedback from [amarhod](https://github.com/amarhod).

With this essay, I aim for a distinction. I do not want to assess how good or bad I met the grading criteria. However, 
I provide a list of how I think about the different aspects.

* Format: The essay is in PDF format.
* Title: I changed the initial title to show the relevance for DevOps/DevSecOps.
* Well-structured: The structure of my essay is slightly similar to a research paper where I try to define everything before it is used.
* Introduction: I show the relevancy of the topic of MSA security for our course topics. From the stated problems, I derive a research question which the essay then answers.
* Conclusion: At the end of the essay, the research question is answered and it is shown how a DevSecOps engineer can benefit from the results.
* Self-contained: The essay assumes that a computer science Master's student has the knowledge on what the eventual security services are and how they can be implemented.
* Innovative: The essay does not show groundbreaking new ideas on how to implement MSA security. However, the essay clearly summarises which security services have to be implemented.
* Figures: The two figures and the table are simple to understand and do not have any distracting elements. They complement the text and are not superfluous.
* Sound: The essay is proofread and understandable by non-computer scientist.
* References: The 15 references are mostly research papers which where also cited by other research papers. The non-research reference is a well known computer scientist. The number is more than the requested minimum but also shows a clear selection of references.
* Elegant: The essay is built with LaTeX. It does not use a plain standard template and shows a clear association to KTH.
* Relevant: The relevance is explained in the introduction.
