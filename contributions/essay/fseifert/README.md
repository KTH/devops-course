### Proposal

To focus more on the security of microservices-based applications (MSAs) and strengthen the presence of DevSecOps, I want to describe the need of securing three layers of MSAs and ideas on how to implement them: communication, application and service orchestration.

### Suitability of Topic

Martin mentioned the suitability of MSAs during the lecture. Furthermore, a [specific GitHub issue](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/issues/11) mentions it. In addition to the suitability of project works about MSAs, the importance of security is already tremendously big and is an important part of DevSecOps.
