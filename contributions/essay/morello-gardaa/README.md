## Description

In this essay we want to present how devops is used to develop quantum computing applications, we give a brief introduction to quantum computing, we describe how the different Devops concept are applied to quanutm computing and we present the specifica case of Azure Quantum development kit.

**Relevance**

While the research is moving fast for quantum hardware and information, quantum software engineering is still at a very early stage, and the gap between these areas is growing large. Other than that Qauntum computing combines all the aspect of classical computing and its challenge with new concept typical of physics.
Therefore applying rigorous software development practice to help develop, build and test quantum and hybrid applications is of primary importance and we want to present how to do that.
