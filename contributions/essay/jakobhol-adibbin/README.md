# Future of containers

* Authors: Jakob Holm (jakobhol@kth.se) & Adibbin Haider (adibbin@kth.se)
* Topic proposal: Will WebAssembly replace containers?

Reason: At the container lecture, Julien Bisconti made a (perhaps offhand) claim that wasm will eventually replace containers, we would like to explore more regarding that.
