## Description

The concept of metamorphic testing (MT) has been around for quite some time. It is a useful technique for bypassing the oracle problem in software testing, and is thereby a useful tool for test case generation. As it turns out, MT finds itself to be relevant in several different topics in Computer Science. One of these topics is Cybersecurity. In other words, MT is capable of enhancing security in such contexts. The purpose of this essay is therefore to explore the state-of-the-art for MT solutions in a Cybersecurity context.

**Relevance**

First of all, automated testing is a topic of importance. MT finds its relevance in the fact that test cases can be automatically generated by addressing the oracle problem. Its apparent connection to Cybersecurity may also be considered to bring relevance, since this on its own is a relevant topic.
