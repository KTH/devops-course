## How to Register Your Topic

Make a pull-request based on the following steps:

- create a folder following the name convention of using email addresses of two members: email-email
- in your folder, create a README.md file and put your topic information there

TA will review the PR. If it is accepted, you could begin your work on this topic, and make another pull-request to submit your work in the future.

## Final Submission

You should make another pull-request which contains your PDF file of the essay.

The PDF filename should end with ".pdf" and should not contain whitespace. Also, the branch from which you create the pull request should contain `essay-submission` in its name. These are required for our Github Action to check if your essay's word count is in the limits.
