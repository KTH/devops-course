## Description

In the essay I will give a short introduction of Cloud Gaming. Following, I will present differences in performance and usage for Cloud Gaming between Containers and Virtual Machines.<br/>
Although leading Cloud Gaming to great benefit, containers were shown to improve also Game Development itself, for example by making the game server's architecture simpler and more scalable.<br/>
Whilst great emphasis is put into comparing the performance differences between the two types of virtualizationon, and also explaining how these can affect the Quality of Service and Quality of Experience, reflections will be made on their usefulness and integration in the currrent DevOps approach to Game Development.
