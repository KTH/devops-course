## Description


In the essay I will give a short introduction of Cloud Gaming. <br/>Following, I will present differences in performance and usage for Cloud Gaming between Containers and Virtual Machines as the cloud servers use virtualization techniques to isolate users and share resources among dedicated servers.<br/>
Although leading Cloud Gaming to great benefit, containers were shown to improve also Game Development itself, for example by making the game server's architecture simpler and more scalable.<br/>
Whilst great emphasis is put into comparing the performance differences between the two types of virtualizationon, and also explaining how these can affect the Quality of Service and Quality of Experience, reflections will be made on their usefulness and integration in the currrent DevOps approach to Game Development.  

**Relevance**

Evaluating Container's performance is of great relevance and importance for DevOps, as gaining greater understanding and relevant benchmarking can help inform less innovation-prone and habitual sectors like Game Development to more extensively use and implement this kind of technology.
