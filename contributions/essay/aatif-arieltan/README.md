### Proposal:

DevOps encompasses a wide tier of tools including CI/CD tools, code repository hosts, and cloud hosting services. We discuss the differences and similarities of these products along with why one would choose one over the other. We will also give examples of organizations that use these services.

* Jenkins vs Travis vs Circle CI
* Azure vs GCP vs AWS
* Gitlab vs Github vs Bitbucket
