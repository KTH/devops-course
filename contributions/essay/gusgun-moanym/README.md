We would like to write a [Medium](https://medium.com/)-style article that gives the reader a complete introductory guide to containers and container orchestration. The article will both be aimed at those who perhaps are confident with containerization but have no experience with orchestration, but also at those who are completely new to both areas. We think the article will do a good job tying together many of the different concepts of DevOps.

The structure of the article will be a follow-along guide to setting up a K8s cluster with a frontend and a backend service. Concepts will be explained as they come along.
