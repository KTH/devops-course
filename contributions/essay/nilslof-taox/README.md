## Description



The CI/CD pipeline allows organizations to quickly and reliably deliver updates on their software. This allows for quick and easy updates, but it also introduces new security risks, as code goes from development to production much quicker. Therefore, it is instrumental to implement counter measures for potential intrusions to the pipeline that works in real time. The host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) can provide detect intrusions in real-time, making them an important tool for the CI/CD pipeline


**Relevance**

The DevSecOps calls for the introduction of security measures in the daily work and the entire production cycle. One part of this cycle is the CI/CD pipeline, which, with its fast-paced delivery, can be vulnerable to intrusions and other security risks. It is therefore necessary to secure the pipeline from these risks, which HIDS can help do.
