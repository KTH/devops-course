    abstract = {<p><p>There are many software engineering concepts and techniques related to software errors. But is this enough? Have we already completely explored the software engineering noosphere with respect to errors and reliability? In this paper, I discuss an novel concept, called "software antifragility", that is unconventional and has the capacity to improve the way we engineer errors and dependability in a disruptive manner. This paper first discusses the foundations of software antifragilty, from classical fault tolerance to the most recent advances on automatic software repair and fault injection in production. This paper then explores the relation between the antifragility of the development process and the antifragility of the resulting software product.</p></p>},
