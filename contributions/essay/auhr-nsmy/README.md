## Description

We would like to start describing and motivating MLOps on a general level, and afterwards narrowing it down to three different popular MLOps frameworks which we will compare. The frameworks we are thinking about are Kubeflow, MLflow and Seldon core. MLOps is a recent field and as of today, there is no standarized way of doing it. For this vision, we want to clarify, highlight and conclude on the differences between the three mentioned frameworks. We hope that this essay will provide directions for the readers to choose a framework that suits their project interests.
