## Topic information
While DevOps accelerates development and enables continuous delivery, security is a part that is still in many cases left to the end of the software development lifecycle. Shifting left on security means that security aspects are moved closer to the developer and begun earlier in the SDLC. The term DevSecOps was coined to describe this concept. 

We want to explain why we need DevSecOps, and compare it to adding security in the end of the lifecycle. We also want to discuss how to successfully integrate security in the SDLC, and which tools one can use.
