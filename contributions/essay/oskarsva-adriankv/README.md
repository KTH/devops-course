**Relevance**

Many companies are transitioning to DevOps for benefits such as agility and scalability. But this is done whilst still being used to other ways of working. For this reason, understanding problems related to DevOps transitioning is of great benefit for companies to make informed decisions.  Perhaps adopting a hybrid approach could be better for a while?
