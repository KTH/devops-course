## Description

When working with the servless computing model a common problem that developers face is the cold start problem. This occurs when your preferred cloud provider needs to start your runtime container because an inactive function was called. This is highly correlated with the Docker lifecycle because it is entirely based on container startup cost, the cost of keeping a container running, and the trade offs between pausing or killing a running container (i.e Docker lifecycle).


Suggestions Addressed:

- Sections 2 and 3 : These sections are not necessary (you can assume that the reader knows the basics of Docker and containers), I suggest removing them.

Fully removed section 3. Renamed section 2 and provided more text as to why it is relevant to the essay topic. 

- Add more references to assess the point about ‘The Influence of Containers on the Cold Start Problem’

Added 2 new sections describing findings from 2 academic articles relating to the section topic.

- Add text to describe every figure.

All figures now have text directly referencing and describing them as well as a caption and citation underneath.

- Section 6: add references and discuss the latest academic research on this topic, use https://dblp.org or https://scholar.google.com/

Added 2 new cutting edge strategies described in 2 research papers found on Google Scholar. Overall added 4 new research paper references and 1 new other source.
