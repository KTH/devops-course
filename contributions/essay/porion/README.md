## Description
DevOps has shown growing success in the Video Game Industry so does automated testing. Now widely adopted, it has become crucial in the process of creating and releasing a game. But the complexity of games calls for plenty of different approaches, aggregating the challenges of software testing, and always pushing further the limits of automatic testing, for example with the recent introduction of AIs to replace manual testers.
**Unit testing, integration testing, network integration testing, performance testing, load testing**, ... are part of the automated test bundle.
The essay will describe the different kinds of tests to be performed on a game based on practical examples like *Rocket League* and *Sea of Thieves*. Greater focus will be set on the network integration and load testing as not yet broached in the course.
