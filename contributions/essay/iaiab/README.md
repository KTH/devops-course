## Description

No doubt, test automation is necessary to improve software quality, make it less error-prone, increase developers' confidence when deploying code, and many other reasons. 

As the code grows and business requirements change, tests may become stale, complex, hard to maintain, and hard to link to a business feature.

Behaviour-driven development allows writing human-readable executable tests using acceptance tests (GWT) format. So that product & development can collaborate in writing these tests, which also can serve as a documentation.

In this essay, I'll demonstrate:
1. What's BDD?
2. How to use it?
3. What's the advantages/disadvantages of using it?
4. How can it serve as both feature documentation and executable tests which runs in the CI?

**Relevance**

BDD is relevant as it's a method of test automation that drives and embrace collaboration between business & tech.
