## Description

Deploying production code isn't always a trivial task. Using the simplest deployment strategy (i.e., Recreate) risks downtime of the application, which is highly undesirable and in many times costly for business. 

Even by mitigating down-time, sometimes new features are too risky to be deployed to all users in big systems as it may be buggy, slow or affect other features.

Sometimes business want to deploy 2 features, monitor and choose one of them at a later stage. Or even deploy a hidden feature to production and then toggle it on.

In this essay I'll discuss the different deployment strategies (e.g., Recreate, Canary Releases, Feature Flags, ...etc.), their benefits, and when we should use them.
