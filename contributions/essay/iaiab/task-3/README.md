## Description

The idea of containers has been around for many years. However, it started becoming popular when Docker was founded and changed the landscape of software development & deployment.

In this essay, I'll talk about the history of containers. First, I'll briefly explain how it all started with the idea of Virtualization at IBM in the 1960s, then in the 1970s when the concept of process isolation in Unix systems came to light up until the early 2000s when process containers (cgroups) introduced by Google and how it helped them to manage their infrastructure. Then Linux Containers (LXC) in the late 2000s, which is considered the first most-complete implementation of container manager until Docker came and became a game-changer technology for DevOps and how they donated Containerd to the CloudNativeFoundation. Then I'll talk about container orchestration and the rise of Kubernetes.

In this history journey I'll explain how in every step these technologies helped DevOps to better manage their infrastructure and how it helped developers to deploy and manage their applications. I'll discuss also how application deployment is today with Kuberenetes and Cloud Native solutions.
