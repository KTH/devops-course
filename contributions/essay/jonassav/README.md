## Description

_I will talk about the benefits and challenges of Canary deployment. I will discuss how these challenges are currently solved in the industry and what tools/platforms are used. I want to investigate to what extent current tools allow Canary deployment to be automated and what potential hurdles exist that future tools could potentially solve._

**Relevance**

_A way to preserve the functionality of a system when introducing new features is highly relevant in DevOps with the intense deployment frequency of the CI/CD pipeline. Gradually introducing new features through Canary deployment could identify errors in production while only affecting a subset of the users._
