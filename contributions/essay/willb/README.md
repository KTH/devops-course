## Description
This essay will introduce the problems of traditional infrastructure management and talk about how infrastructure as code (IaC) solutions address these problems. I will then present Puppet as an example of an IaC tool and explain how it is used for configuration management and infrastructure automation. Similar tools will also be mentioned and compared in a section on the state of the art. Finally, a reflection on the pros and cons of these solutions will precede a final conclusion.

**Relevance**

DevOps is all about automation for speed and reliability. IaC is relevant in this regard since it allows developers to automate infrastructure tasks that are repetitive and error prone. Puppet, as an IaC tool, enables developers to deliver software with greater speed and consistency by managing infrastructure configurations as code.
