## Description

We want to make a comparison between the threat modeling methodologies such as Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis (PASTA) and STRIDE.
These are well known methodologies in the DevSecOps world. We will discuss the 6 categories of STRIDE and the 7 step risk-centric methodology of PASTA
and compare those 2.

**Relevance**

It is relevant to DevOps, because P.A.S.T.A. and STRIDE threat modeling are activities that provides a team with the ability to pro-actively think about security during development process. It can also be used as a platform to upskill team members and spread knowledge about
security threats. \

A good way to introduce security in project pipelines is to focus on a shift left approach, i.e. to start thinking about security in the beginning of a DevOps workflow, instead of in the end.
