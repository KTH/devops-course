## Description

Containers have for a while now been the go to for developing microservices, 
using Kubernetes or other container orchestrating tools for easy scaling
and container maintenance.

Serverless seems to be the new big thing for developers. It enables developers to 
build and run applications and services without having to manage and orchestrate 
the underlying infrastructure, such as scaling and maintenance.

This essay aims to examine the key differences between the two technologies and
where the one might outshine the other.
