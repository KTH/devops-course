## Description

Serverless seems to be the new big thing for developers. It enables developers to 
build and run applications and services without having to manage and orchestrate 
the underlying infrastructure, such as scaling and maintenance. With this essay I 
aim to describe why serverless is a thing and what it is, how it may be implemented, 
and what obstacles may arise when having a serverless architecture.
