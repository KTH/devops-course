# A/B Testing - A Search Based Approach

A/B testing is an increasingly popular way of creating an environment of continuous experimentation. It can provide a lot of insight into user behaviour and preference, however, it comes with a lot of challenges. By reformulating A/B testing as an optimization problem, search based software engineering practices such as genetic algorithms can be applied, and to some extent help in the creation of tests. This new area of automated tests shows promise for the future, while still having some unsolved issues such as creation of complex combinations of features and dependency detection among them.
