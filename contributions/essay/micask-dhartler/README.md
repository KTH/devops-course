## Description
OpenJDK is a popular open source implementation of the Java SE platform, used to develop, run and deploy java applications. Its repo contains over 70k commits and receives several new ones per day. Because of their frequent acceptance of commits and big code base, several DevOps practices are employed.

In our essay we intend to analyze the practices of the OpenJDK github repo and see how well they apply some of the theoretical concepts that we have learned about in the course in practice. We will mainly analyze their CI/CD pipeline and automation, DevSecOps, and legal aspects.

**Relevance**

Given the nature of open source projects with a lot of contributors, DevOps practices are necessary for work to efficiently be done. However, not all repositories employ the same pipelines and practices. Therefore we think it would be interesting to give an insight into how a big repository is managed, especially when both big companies and individuals are able to contribute, which is the case for OpenJDK.
