## Description
We want to investigate the cultural aspects of open source projects when it comes to managing their DevOps pipeline and how organizational issues such as various conflicts that may arise are dealt with among different open source projects. 

We also intend to find what some key insights are from successful open source projects that have managed to keep a healthy DevOps cycle running for a long time.

**Relevance**
Many open source projects heavily rely on good DevOps practices. Since it can be difficult to get a good overview and start contributing using a DevOps pipeline to open source projects given their different organizational approaches, our essay will hopefully help dispel some of those difficulties.
