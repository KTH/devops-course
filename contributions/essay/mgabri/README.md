As there is a another group writing about Devops in AWS i whould like to take a deep dive into how AWS's main compatior does the same thing. This would be interesting to se how they stack up against each other and therefore i whould like to look into the same topics as the fore mentionded group such that a easy comparison can be made by someone reading both. 

The focus will be on:

-   Benefits of Azure compared to a clasically deployed server setup
-   What development approaches Azure encourages
-   Draw a parallel between these Azure approaches and the core ideas of DevOps development
-   Give concrete examples of what Azure services correspond to what DevOps practices
