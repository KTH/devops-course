## Proposal

I want to create an essay where I discuss the basics of FaaS, Serverless Technologies and how they can be used to DevOpsify an application. I also specifically want to talk about the potential for a technology such as [Google Cloud Run](https://cloud.google.com/run)

The topics that will be discussed in the essay:

- Basic Introduction to Cloud
- Basic Understanding of Serverless, relevant terminology and how it relates to DevOps
- How Serverless can be leveraged to simplify the production of large-scale application
- How Serverless can be leveraged to DevOpsify an infrastructure
- How leveraging Serverless and Containerization can be used to simplify the production of large-scale application
