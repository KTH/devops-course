## Description

One of the key goals of DevOps is to [accelerate the time-to-resolution](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/what-is-devops/benefits-of-devops). Extensive monitoring of the deployed system is required to allow fast problem analysis when an error occurs.

An excellent option is to use an IoT management platform to collect log data from IoT fleets. 

In my essay, I want to elaborate on why and in what ways such platforms are needed to enable companies to maintain large fleets of IoT products. My discussion will be based on the functionality of the open-source platform [Thingsboard.io](https://thingsboard.io/), a great tool that can be used for free by anybody.
