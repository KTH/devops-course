## Description

My goal is to compare the Continuous Integration functionalities of the two largest source control platforms. 
Initial research has shown that GitLab and GitHub choose different approaches for their Continuous Integration functionalities in some aspects. The aim is to work out the respective weaknesses and strengths of the platforms to draw a short conclusion at the end, for which tasks which platform is better. To create a practical comparison, I plan to create the same CI/CD pipeline using Github and Gitlab respectively, and then also evaluate the process.
