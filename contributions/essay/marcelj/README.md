## Description

The term MLOps gained significance because of the many steps that are involved in the machine learning (ML) development and deployment process. These complicated processes pose a great challenge which is adressed by Kubeflow that leverages Kubernetes, which is a highly demanded technology in the ML field. 

Firstly I want to give an overview of what Kuebernetes is and why it became so popular. Secondly, I want to to describe the Kubeflow platform that builds on Kubernetes and aims at enhancing the process of developing and deploying ML systems. There is a natural hierachy: Kubeflow builds on Kubernetes, Kubernetes builds on Docker. Therefore, I will explain all three technologies, dedicating roughly 50% of the content to Docker+Kubernetes and Kubeflow respectively. The essay will give a coherent picture of how DevOps technologies can simplify the machine learning process.
