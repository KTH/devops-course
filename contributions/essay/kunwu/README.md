### Proposal

How to build a large-scale stable system if its components could possibly fail? This has been a issue for
many years. 

In this paper, I'll describe how software architecture has been evolving to address this issue, from [Mainframe computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer), to [Distributed computing] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), to [Monolithic application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application), to [Service-oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture), to [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), to [Service Mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_mesh), to [Serverless computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing), etc..

Through the this ever-changing trend, we can have a holistic view of how possible failure is handled in different times and how to build up automated exception handling which ensures a stable and robust performance.


### Suitability of Topic

A rolling stone gathers no moss. Devops, as part of system infrastructure, ensure that every single service in the whole system can die and reboot without disturbing the overall performance. 

This paper talks about how this sustainability is addressed in different architectural styles.
