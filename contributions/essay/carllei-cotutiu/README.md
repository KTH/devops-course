### Topic
In this essay we discussed the opposition as well as collaboration relationship that exists between ITOps and Devops.
We started from understanding what ITOps involves, how it differs from DevOps and what are the core aspects that push these two apart.
We then explored how they can actually collaborate to enhance the development and maintenance process by ensuring flexibility and speed while maintaining stability and security.    

We believe that the subject is of great interest to DevOps because. Despite the opposing positions that each take in relationship to the other, the collaboration between them strikes a much-needed balance that accelerates the otherwise slow process associated with ITOps, while tempering the dynamic od DevOps.

## Documented changes after feedback

### Introduction
 - Grammatical error: Due to this dependency, arose [...]
 
 **The sentence has been changed to:
    Due to this dependency, appropriate tools and best practices [...]**
   
 - Currently, the intro is short and precise. Perhaps there is a too large focus on ITOps, there could be more of a discussion regarding both DevOps and ITOps in broader terms. The essay is about the relationship between these two practices, so I think a more even split would be apropriate.
 
 **Altered the text correspondingly, to reflect the relationship between DevOps and ITOps:**
    The need for DevOps arose when technology companies required a more agile and quicker approach than ITOps to software development. However, when ITOps is used in conjunction with DevOps, it can generate a set of issues ranging from conflicting goals and practices to a potential need for responsibility shift between teams.
 
### ITOps
 - Adapted text based on feedback to better reflect the role of ITOps in a company.
 
### Differences between ITOps and DevOps
 - I think giving the figure in this section a caption would be good (actually all figures should have this), because right now it seems quite sudden and a reader may not be able to fully digest what the authors are trying to say with it.

 **All figures now have captions and are referenced in text**
 
 - I also think you could incorporate some of the differences mentioned in the figure in the essay as well. You could take about how DevOps os more decentralised while ITOps is more centralised, for example.
 
 **Added a discussion about batch sizes of DevOps and ITOps, based on the image** 

### The Ways ITOps and DevOps Work Together
 - One issue that can occur between the DevOps and ITOps that the essay mentions is change: The problem that we would like to highlight is related to an inevitable and frequently occurring phenomenon in software development, namely, change. Could this be elaborated more? Perhaps discuss what type of change that can cause this?
 
 **We added explanation of what a change might be in this context:**
 
 - One sentence is very long and hard to understand, I'd suggest breaking it down: More specifically, when both teams are provided with real-time, comprehensive, and accurate data which is extracted, under a standard model, from a data pool, a foundation for decision making is created.
   
   **The sentence was divided in two:**
   
   *More specifically, when both teams are provided with real-time, comprehensive, and accurate data, a foundation for decision-making is created. This data is extracted, under a standard model, from a data pool.*
 
### Common Tools for ITOps and DevOps

(this section title has been changed to better reflect the content)
 - The figure reference is wrong here.
 
 **Changed figure reference. Now it is figure Fig. 5.1**
 
 - The figure in general is not really discussed, it's just a table with some tools. I'd like the authors to go through it a bit more and highlight some noticeable tools. Perhaps a caption would do great here.
 
 **We added a caption to the table and discussed the main classes of tools**
 
### Conclusions
    
  **Rewrote the conclusions section such that it takes into acount both points made in the feedback. Due to word limit constraints we decided to focus on reiterating the differences between ITOps and DevOps and give an insight into how their future collaboration might be influenced by AI.**
  
### Some general comments
 - I think the essay is quite broad when discussing some terms. I'm not sure if this should be changed considering the scope of this essay. Personally, I'd like more clarity regarding ITOps at least, I feel like we were barely brushing on the surface.
 
 **Based on your feedback we went over our essay and made some changes to present the subject as clear as possible, while keeping the text within the required word limits.**
 
 - I think you should use figure captions on all of your figures. I also think you should refer to them more often.
 
 **We added captions to each figure and referenced them at least once in the text**
 
 - Perhaps more scientific sources would be good to use in your report. Here are some that I found with Google Scholar, perhaps they are relevant to you?
 
 **As much as we appreciate the intention to provide useful material, we already looked at the provided sources, however, they don't fit into our topic and don't provide meaningful information. However, we made another attempt at searching for more academic sources on our topic.**
