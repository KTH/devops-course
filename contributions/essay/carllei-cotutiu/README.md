### Proposal
We propose writing a comparison between ITOPS and DEVOPS.
We think it is important to understand both, how they differ and how they can be used together to improve the development process.

### Structure
1. What is ITOPS?
2. How does ITOPS differ from DEVOPS?
3. How does ITOPS and DEVOPS work together?
4. What are some popular ITOPS tools? Are they also used in DEVOPS?
