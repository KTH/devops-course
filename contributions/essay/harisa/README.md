I'd like to write about containerisation aimed at
someone who has just heard of the concept and would
like to get an introdcution to the topic.

Areas I'm thinking of including right now are:

* What are containers?
  * Brief introduction

* Setup
  * Example of how to setup a container for trying out fuzzing coreutils
  * Including how one can upload their own container to Docker Hub

* History
  * LXC
  * Docker
  * Before VMs (one application/server)
  * After VMs
  * Today

* Containers vs VMs

* Containers-at-scale
  * Kubernetes
  * Docker Swarm

The areas to include is subject to change once I start writing and
the essay starts taking form.
