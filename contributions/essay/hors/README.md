# [Helm](<https://helm.sh/>)

The Aim of this project is to test Helm, a tool for managing and versioning kubernetes resources.
First I would note down my journey to integrate Helm into a simple gitlab repository and in the CI/CD pipeline. Thereafter I would like to focus on some findings and interesting further functionalities which I probably find on my way.
