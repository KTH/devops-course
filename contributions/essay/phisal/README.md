## Description

This [systemic mapping of IaC research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584918302507) suggests a number of potential research avenues within the area of IaC. This essay intends to focus on two of them, namely the challenges faced by the practitioners of IaC, and the best practices
that could enable them to overcome these challenges. The areas will be combined into one essay that first poses the challenges to then propose solutions, and will do so by focusing on both scientific research as well as gray literature.
