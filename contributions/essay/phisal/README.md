## Description

During the rise of IaC, a number of tools and platforms have been established. However, these tools are quite heterogeneous by differing in a nuumber of important ways.
Investigating the main differences by a comparitive study of these tools could be of great benifit when making a long term choice in investing in a perticular IaC technology.
This study will do precisely that by investigating four different tools, which are divided into two open source and two closed source alternatives, namely Terraform and Pulumi
as well as Google Cloud Deployment Manager and AWS CloudFormation.
