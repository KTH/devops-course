## Description

Today, there is most likely no software that does not make use of external code libraries. With the established use of packages and package managers, with their increasing ease of use in today's world of development, it is important that one maintains security within their projects. OWASP describes this as "Component-heavy development patterns can lead to development teams not even understanding which components they use in their application or API, much less keeping them up to date".

This essay will the current landscape of dependency management, security, and implementation (how to implement security in a DevSecOps pipeline), while also investigating security breaches that have previously occured from dependency vulnerabilities. In closing it will reflect on these issues while offering some practical advice.

**Relevance**

As more companies make use of external dependencies in their systems it is a responsibility to make sure that they are used safely. DevSecOps integrates this security aspect into the development pipeline and could in this instance regard the integration of the many different dependencies in a secure way.
