## Description

We will research different architectural patterns in the context of the modern cloud. More specifically, there are trade-offs associated with Monolith, Distributed Monolith and Microservice approaches. Our essay aims describe challenges with each pattern and also provide a discussion for when each pattern may be a good choice. E.g., microservices is a hot topic that many see as the "gold-standard" architectural pattern. We dig deeper to see if this is always the case and whether the more traditional Monolith could remain viable.



**Relevance**

It is relatively easy to see that the choice of architectural pattern directly impacts an organizations requirements for DevOps maturity. A monolith will tend to require less DevOps maturity while deploying and orchestrating microservices likely requires more.
