## Description

This essay will explore how Infrastructure as Code (IaC) works in AWS. We will explain what tools AWS offers for IaC, and what they are used for.

This includes: AWS CloudFormation, AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK), AWS Cloud Development Kit for Kubernetes, AWS Cloud Development Kit for Terraform, AWS Cloud Control API.

**Relevance**

IaC tools are very relevant for DevOps as they provide indespencable functionality relating to the CI/CD process. IaC introduces the best CI/CD practices into even provisioning of infrastructure in the cloud, as opposed to only providing CI/CD for application code.
