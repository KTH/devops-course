## Description

In this essay, I will discuss the what CI/CD pipeline breaches such as https://blog.gitguardian.com/codecov-supply-chain-breach/ is. I will focus on techniques such as mapping the attack vector(observing and monitoring), depency analysis, securing the pipeline with automated tools such as testing (unit, application etc), and credential management. To show an state of the art example, I will also have a section on machine learning integration. 


**Relevance**

With supply chain attacks becoming more popular, it's a good idea to have a good understanding of what supply chain security is and how devops can be used to make it more reciliant against attacks. It's also important for a devops engineer to be able to look at a CI/CD Pipeline and be able to pinpoint weaknesses.
