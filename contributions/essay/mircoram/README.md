## Description

In this essay, I will discuss the pros and cons of both serverless architecture and containers as well as compare them. The essay will discuss for different types of programmes and focus on the architectures rather than one specific programme type. 


**Relevance**

Serverless and containers are both often discussed in devops and their actual application is highly relevant. Comparing them and discussing what types of programmes should use them (or use them together) is an interesting topic.
