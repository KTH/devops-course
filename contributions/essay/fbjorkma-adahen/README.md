### Proposal:
We want to dive into how Jira works, the advantages you can gain from using Jira in your projects and the value of implementing agile project managment in your company using these kind of tools.

### Proposed outline
- What is agile project management (briefly)
- What is Jira and how does Jira work
- Advantages of using Jira or simliar program
- Reflection about how Jira is used today and if it is a program that should be used in modern project management

## Feedback change log
We recieved feedback from Axel Elmarsson (axelelm@kth.se) Github: [elmaxe](https://github.com/elmaxe) and Kitty Thai (kittyt@kth.se) Github: [kittytinythai](https://github.com/kittytinythai).
Thank you for good and constructive feedback!

The following changes were made from the feedback we recieved:

### General
>Feedback: For the front page I would consider capitalizing every word of the essay, since we are writing an essay in English ("Agile Project Management with Jira" instead of "Agile project management with Jira"
>
Change made: Change the title as suggested. Agile Project Management with Jira

>Feedback: Figures should be referred to, otherwise there is no meaning in having them. You are currently only referring to figure 1 and 2. The rest (3, 4, 5, 6) you need to refer to or remove completely.
>
Change made: Removed “Figure 3 Kanban board example” and added cross references to the Figures that did not have any.

### 1 Introduction
>Feedback: In this essay, the agile project management tool Jira will be discussed ~~and the~~ , **as well as** advantages and disadvantages of using Jira in the software development process.

Feedback: "We will not go into how to set up..." -> "we will not go into detail about how to set up..." is better phrasing I think.
>
Changes made: Adopted both of these suggestions.

### 2 Background
>Feedback: This ~pretty much~ assumes that the developing team has complete and perfect information about the ~project's goal~ **goals of the project** and expected solution**s**.
>
>Feedback: In modern software development, ~where~ radical changes in the customer requirements may occur frequently. **N**ew innovative ideas may arise from competitors or other unexpected events may happen that need to be addressed, **there is** a need for **flexibility** and the ability to react quickly is essential for the development process.
>
>Feedback: With the need for a more agile development process, agile methodologies ~like~ **such as** Scrum and Kanban became more popular due to the more iterative approach of the software development.
>
Changes made: Adopted these three suggestions.

>Feedback: Perhaps you should refer to Figure 1 earlier in the text. Currently you are referring to it after you have talked about agile methods (end of page 3). I think it would be better to refer to figure 1 in the end of the first paragraph, and only refer to figure 2 in the end of the third paragraph.
>
Changes made: Acted on this feedback and moved the first cross reference to the first paragraph. 

### 3.1 What is Jira?
>Feedback from 3.4: I think you shouldn't write "our product" and "we need to follow". I would prefer "What are the formal requirements of the product and the regulations that needs to be followed". The former is more personal, like you're talking about a product you have, but these are instructions for any project. In the following points for example, you are doing it correctly: You are not writing "what did our team do well..." for example.
>
Applied this feedback here too and rewrote this be more formaly written:

"**We will** first **show** the features that help individual developers and small teams to organize their work and optimize their time. **Then, we scale back and talk about** the features that help managers plan and organize important milestones, get actionable data, achieve long-term goals, **and win**

->

First the features that help individual developers and small teams to organize their work and optimize their time **will be shown.** After that, the features that help managers plan and organize important milestones, get actionable data, achieve long-term goals, **beat the competition and deliver value to customers will be discussed.**

### 3.2 Organize tasks, introducing Kanban
>Feedback: ~If you cannot see what problems exist, it's hard to fix it.~ It's hard to fix problems if you cannot see them.
>
>Feedback: Although, this system breaks down if there are too many planned tasks ~already planned~
that need to be completed, or even worse, too many tasks that never get completed.
>

Changes made: Applied both these suggestions.

#### 3.2.2 Iterative development and sprints
>Feedback: By using a ~Sccrum~ **Scrum** board template for your project instead of Kanban, you can group issues in "sprints".
>
Changes made: Adopted this suggestion.

>Feedback: team's instead of teams.
There are plenty of tools that managers can use to plan sprints and track the team's progress
>
Changes made: We did not adopt this change, but we rephrased this sentence to: 

There are plenty of tools that managers can use to plan sprints and track **the progress of the teams**

>Feedback: Perhaps you should add: "That question we will answer in the following question" or something in those lines after the last question in this section.
>
>Feedback: I think the second paragraph in this section belongs to the text under section 3. It is because this paragraph describes what the entire section 3 will address instead of what Jira is. Also the last sentence of this section would maybe suit the coming section 3.2, mostly because it is a good starting sentence for that section.
>
Changes made: Both these are reffering to this question: “But what does Agile project management look like in Jira?”. We decided to remove the question instead of moving it.

### 3.4 Knowledge management with Confluence
>Feedback: Maybe rephrase this sentence, I'm not sure what you are trying to say here. Especially the last part of the sentence. Confluence is designed to store knowledge from all parts of the organization and **restrict access wherever necessary**.
>
Changes made: Change the sentence to: Confluence is designed to store knowledge from all parts of the organization and restrict access **to critical business documents within your organization** wherever necessary.

>Feedback: I think you shouldn't write "our product" and "we need to follow". I would prefer "What are the formal requirements of the product and the regulations that needs to be followed". The former is more personal, like you're talking about a product you have, but these are instructions for any project. In the following points for example, you are doing it correctly: You are not writing "what did our team do well..." for example.
>
Changes made: Rewrote it more formaly: "What are the formal requirements of the product and the regulations that needs to be followed."

### 4 Conclusion
>Feedback: This suite of products deliver a powerful toolset for managers striving to implement **the** agile **workflow**, so teams can quickly learn, change and grow over time, while still meeting its obligations and long-term goals.
>
Changes made: Adopted these suggestion.
