## Proposal
The essay aims to present different ways of automating tests for infrastructure code when using tools such as Terraform and Kubernetes. Although the essay will not focus on any specific tool, rather give an general overview.

The essay will cover:
* What is infrastructure code
* Why should you test it
* Challanges in automated testing of infrastructure code
* How to test it (e.g. static analysis, unit tests, integration tests)
