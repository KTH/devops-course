## Description

My goal is to compare these three paradigms in producing software in the context of a DevOps team. I weigh the pros and cons for each approach based on a few criteria:

- Produced software quality.
- How does it work together with continuous delivery.
- Environment for learning.
- Development time and cost.
  - I plan to consider remote teams as well as regular teams

After a initial glance at the literature, I expect that pair and mob programming provide more pros than solo programming. However, that which paradigm is most successful is highly situational.
