## Description:

Code Coverage is all well and good but sometimes projects get so large that it is not feasible to cover the entirety of the code with tests.
Furthermore we all know instinctively that all code is not equally likely to produce errors. 
Thus, we want to spend precious time writing tests where it matters the most.

How do we then know what to test?

Software metrics to the rescue! 
Measuring certain aspects of code to determine where errors are most likely to appear can then help to increase code coverage specifically where it is needed. 

## Preliminary Outline:

* Introduction
  * What is code coverage?
  * What is software measurement?
* Discussion
  * Relation between code coverage and software measurement
  * Comparison of common software metrics
      * NCLOC
      * Cyclomatic Complexity
      * Halstead's Metrics
      * Others
  * Usefulness of software measurement
  * Differences between languages/paradigms
* Conclusion
  * Key points
