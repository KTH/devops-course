## Topic

I want to learn more about containers and how they differ from VMs. 
More specifically, I would like to cover how they can be used in a DevOps context and the
benefits and drawbacks of each solution.

## Preliminary structure

- Introduction
- Background
	- What is a VM, how does it work?
	- What is a container?
	- Images
- Differences between containers and VMs.
- Benefits and drawbacks, when to use which solution?
- An more specific example covering two common tools and how they can be used in DevOps. (Will choose a specific tool of each)
- Conclusions
