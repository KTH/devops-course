# ESSAY PROPOSAL: Everything Continuous Deployment: For Beginners

Based on the feedback given the scope of the essay have changed. This essay will focus on continuous deployment and related practices to give the reader an understanding of what continuous deployment is and what is needed for it to work. Another goal is also to provide reasons for why one would want to implement continuous deployment.

This essay is also only written by me, Keivan Matinzadeh, since my partner Gustav Dowling failed a repetition of another task.
