### Topic

How to build a large-scale stable system if its components could possibly fail? This has been a issue for
many years. 

In this paper, I'll describe how software architecture has been evolving to address this issue, from [Mainframe computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer), to [Distributed computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_computing), to [Monolithic application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application), to [Service-oriented architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture), to [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices), to [Service Mesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_mesh), to [Serverless computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serverless_computing), etc..

Through the this ever-changing trend, we can have a holistic view of how possible failure is handled in different times and how to build up automated exception handling which ensures a stable and robust performance.
