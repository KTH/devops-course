## Description

Subject: Transitioning from DevOps to DevSecOps 

Why: In our exploratory work, we found that the transtion from a DevOps environment to a DevSecOps one usually comes with a lot of new tools and techniques. We plan to explain normal tools and rituals used in DevSecOps in contrast to a normal DevOps one. These are tools such as SAST, DAST, IAST and RASP with rituals such as threat modeling during the planning phase and much more.
