## Description

There is a variety of standards and frameworks for cybersecurity out there. While some are very industry-specific,
the most widely used one is the ISO/IEC 27000 family, including the popular ISO/IEC 27001 on information security management systems.
The german BSI (the federal authority for information security) created their own standard based on the 27001 norm, called
["IT-Grundschutz"](https://www.bsi.bund.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/EN/BSI/Grundschutz/International/bsi_it_gs_comp_2021.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=4).
Compared to the underlying norm it contains a very specific set of requirements for a wide range of domains, including software development and the
development of web applications.

The goal of the essay is, to identify all requirements related to DevOps. In a second step alternative resources for best practices and security measures in DevSecOps
will be gathered, analysed and compared to the requirements in the BSI norm. Finally the essay will try to determine possible additions to the german standard.

**Relevance**

While best-practices are often a good start, we need ways to analyse the maturity of a system's cybersecurity measures and to certify that a system fulfills
a certain standard to call it reasonably secure. The "holy grail" for that in germany, especially in the environment of federal authorities, is the BSI
IT-Grundschutz standard. This means that it also applies for software projects within these authorities. However the norm seems to contain surprisingly
few requirements concerning DevOps. To improve cybersecurity, especially facing a very high threat-level at latest since the beginnning of the ukraine war,
it seems important to use an up-to-date standard for current software projects.
