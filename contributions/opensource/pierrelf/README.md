## Description

Apache CloudStack is an IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) platform used to build self hosted cloud providers. 

It is used by many organizations thanks to its ease of installation and management, and open source nature.

The contribution would be to fix one of the many issues in the UI, many of which I have experienced myself, to bring a better experience to users of CloudStack.

This would include finding and repairing the erroneous code in the UI component, and perhaps patching some Java backend code in case that is where the issue originates from.

**Relevance**

CloudStack being a cloud platform is highly relevant for DevOps. CloudStack also provides adapters for Terraform, Kubernetes and other widely used DevOps tools.
