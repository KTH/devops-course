Testing the GUI (graphical user interface) of your applications is an important part of DevOps. Manual testing of the GUI is possible, but it can be quite tedious, time consuming and not very robust. So how does one go ahead and test the GUI of a JavaFX application automatically? The testing framework TestFX allows the developer to write automated GUI tests for applications developed with JavaFX. This allows for extensive automated GUI testing, enabling the developer to write tests that make sure all parts of the GUI works as intented and expected.
