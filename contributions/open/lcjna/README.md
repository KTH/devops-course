# Taking Down Production

## A cautionary tale about the need for testing

My proposal is to create a short animated website that is a mockup of a dashboard where you can see the status of microservices or perhaps servers, and a log showing git pull requests in to the production branch. Before too long a bad commit is merged and you can witness the destruction of the production environment.

This follows by another version where each commit is run against tests before being accepted in to the production branch - a "what you should be doing" version.

## How To Use

Browsers tested with:

- ✅Chrome version 73.0.3683.103 (Official Build) (64-bit) (Mac)
- ✅Firefox Developer Edition version 67.0b14 (64-bit) (Mac)
- ❌ Safari version 12.1 (14607.1.40.1.4) (Mac)

Open index.html in Chrome or Firefox and sit back to enjoy the ride. Javascript is required for this to work. If the modal at the end does not show then manually open indexwithtests.html in your browser for part 2.
