## Topic
Connected to issue #118, CI hackathon.

We define the preliminary structure of the hackathon repo to be one main repo and all teams fork from this repo.

Visualize the activity across all the forks and main repo used at the hackathon in real time. Display contributions of all participants and the languages used in each fork.

If we find more interesting statistics we will add them to the visualization.

### About

This project has set up a dashboard that can be used to monitor the activity of a github repository, including forks, pull requests and so on. The main idea was to set up something to prepare for the hackathon at Software days in October.

The dashboard is right now configured for the linked repo, but see in the README of the repo for how to change this.
