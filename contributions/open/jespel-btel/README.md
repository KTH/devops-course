# Flaky Test

![ecg](https://i.imgur.com/PJBc6GD.png)

We would like to create an art project representing flaky tests as our open project.

Our idea is to create an animation of an ECG that works most of the time, but sometimes for no reason flatlines for a short while before it returns to normal.

Our idea is to create a small webpage to hold this animation. Our plan is develop this website using some DevOps techniques (such as CI, auto deployment, containers).

We created the image above as small exploatory project to understand the techniques to create the ECG effect.
