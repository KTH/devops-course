# Simple Selenium framework for Python

Based on Anuj Kumar's work - "PWAF", we want to continue his work to complete the rest work to make the open source become more concrete and sound.

Here is the work should be finished.

Thus, this open project could benefit web developers/QA engineers with their projects.
