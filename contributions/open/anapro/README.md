Opentask: Kubernetes with Mesh Service (Istio)

Members: Anastasia Protopapa

Task: Setup Kubernetes with some service and connect to Istio (perhaps experiment with canary release if there is time)

I added a tutorial introduction file that describes the steps I followed to learn K8s and Istio.
Together with the steps I describe some very basic concepts and what I learned for their functionality.
As I mention it is a very basic introduction on K8s and Istio and how to do route traffic on specific pods/versions
