# Course Automation: Automatic email of confirmation for PR and group checking

## Description

This course automation is designed to be activated whenever a PR is merged in the directory "contributions", 
and it sends an email to the interested students that contains the details of the PR, and a calendar event on the date of the deadline.

Here below you can find the links to the GitHub repo of the action, a link to the tutorial and demonstration that the action works, and finally the link to the GitHub marketplace page where we uploaded our action.
