## Description
>>>>>>> c8256791c23d36e784db95dcccd9bd8e638d7625

In order to alleviate __redundant work__ for this course TAs I propose to automate verification of the following mandatory parts for ["course-automation"](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/blob/2022/grading-criteria.md#course-automation):

-   timeliness: the automation is done before the __first task__ deadline (in order to be useful for the course)
        The first task deadline should be a set as a variable that can be changed for each year. If the final pull request to this repo is after __first task__, the pull request should become invalid.
-   repo: the code for the task is available in a public repo
        Check through the `readme.md` for a github-url and check whether the repo is public or not

The automation should perform the following :

-   Run for each new pull request that is the course automation task
-   Check if it is a final submission (i.e has a repo-link)
    - if final: check if it is before __first task__ deadline and if repo is __public__
    - if not final: check if it is before __first task__
-   Give feedback accordingly to the pull request
