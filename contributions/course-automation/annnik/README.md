## Proposal 
The goal of this automation is to help TAs and Professors to reach students through Discord with imergent announsements. If the "Extra"-section is implemented the action will also decrease the respond time from the students on making changes to their pull requests

## What the action does 

 - ✅    Filter the actors (should only be triggered for TAs and professors actions) 
 - ✅    Filter events (on what event´s should it be triggered: new issues/ change in head README / special commits..)
 - ✅    Standarize format (so that action can be triggerd for several types of events by ex using labels)
 - ✅    Integrate with Discord
 - ✅    Customize what information should be included in the Discord messages
 - ✅    Send messages to Discord

## Extra (if time allows)
I would also want to make it possible to customize this action so the event can be triggered:
 - to the official discord channel (when it conserns all course members)
 - to only person it conserns 


## May change
The precise logic on first 3 points will be developed further with the goal of making the automation elegeant and intuitive
