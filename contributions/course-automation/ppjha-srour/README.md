## Description

Create a github action upon each PR labeled **presentation** and **final_submission** will 
check for a link to the slides. To do this we can either 
- check all links in the repo and see if there is a valid link to some slides
- create a presentation README template with a section named *Presentation slides*, 
and every PR will check to see if the format of the README is correct and if there is a valid link under that section.
