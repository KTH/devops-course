## Proposal

We would like to propose a task that will create a bot that takes submitted essays and submits them to the hemingway editor (https://hemingwayapp.com/) and returns some useful feedback on the essay in the form of a comment.


This will thus be a bot that:
* Takes the submitted essay PDF and converts it into a workable format.
* Submits the text and takes the feedback.
* Restructures it into a suitable comment and posts it back on the issue.
