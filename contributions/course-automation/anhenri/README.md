## Proposal

I would like to check the length of the demo video so that it fulfills the requested length.


For this, I will do a Github action on pushes that concernes the demo folder.
Extract the url to the youtube video
Check the length of the video and if it is between 3 and 5 minutes
Update PR status

## Result
The developed Github Action can be found [here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/youtube-checker)
