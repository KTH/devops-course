## Description

Currently all pull requests needs to be manually labeled by the course TAs.
Because this is tedious to do, some pull requests don't get labeled and are therefore harder to sort or search for.

I want to solve this by creating a GitHub Action that searches for keywords in pull requests and labels the pull request accordingly.
