## Proposal

We would like to create a GitHub action that would automatically check the requirements for an open-souce contribution.

The action should check that repo has:
- More than 10 stars
- More than 100 commits
- An active community
  - open to interpretation
  - provide stats on what has happend the last year (comments, PRs, commits)

We believe that checking that a project is related to DevOps may be too difficult for the purposes of this project.
