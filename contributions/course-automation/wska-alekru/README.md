## Introduction

This contribution takes the form of a bot which is capable of providing feedback on an essay submission by utilizing the online-hosted hemingway editor (https://hemingwayapp.com/). The hemingway editor will provide some general information about the text that was published, including:
* A approximative grade of the readability of the paper (generated by a heuristic)
* Word count
* Reading time
* Quantity of adverbs utilized
* Uses of a passive voice
* Phrases which could be rewritten in a simpler manner
* Number of difficult to read sentences
* Number of VERY difficult to read sentences

## General functionality
The program performs the following steps when execution initiates:
1. Scans the pull requests available on the designated repo and looks for comments including the "!hemingway" tag.
2. If the pull request contains a pdf file, it will download it and convert it into a raw text file using pdf2txt.py library (https://pypi.org/project/pdf2text/). 
3. The text will then pass into a hemingway function, which utilizes selenium and google chrome to open a web browser and input the raw text (https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/).
4. It will then fetch the relevant feedback provided by the hemingway editor and create a short summary.
5. This is then returned and posted as a comment to the original pull request using a dedicated bot-account. Git interactions are done using pygithub (https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).

## How to use
The bot will trigger its search upon seeing a pull request conducted to the ./contributions/essay path. In order to obtain hemingway feedback, one needs to either include a comment on the pull request which includes "!hemingway" (with a exclamation mark), or include the phrase in the body of the pull request.

The search can also be manually started by going into Github Actions and scheduling the "hemingway'' job. This might be necessary if one makes a comment after a pull request and wants to obtain feedback.
