## Proposal
We would like to use github actions to propose teammates for students.
Students can open an issue to request for teammates.

When the student searching for a legal teammate, a list will be given of students' email addresses, where they have the following criteria:

- The potential teammate has posted < 4 project proposals
- The students and the potential teammate have not worked in the same group more than once before
- The potential teammate has not yet proposed a project in that category.

For example:

Looking for a teammate: 
carinawi@kth.se

Legal teammates:
course-automation: arieltan@kth.se, arieltan2@kth.se, arieltan3@kth.se...
Essay: ...


We aim to fulfill the following criteria:
|                                             | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|-------------------------------------------- | ----|----|-------------|

|The automation task produces a PR status or issue / PR comment	| **Yes**	|No	|Points to a generated page with valuable additional information|
