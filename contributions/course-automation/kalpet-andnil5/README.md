 ## Proposal
We want to solve the issue described by baudry in #916.
"Check that all PR submitted for the course come from a Github id that corresponds to one KTH id of a student who registered for the course"

 ## Proposed solution:

* Create a GitHub javascript action to be run on each PR.
* Extract the GitHub id of the PR author.
* Create a list of valid kth ids (from students registered to course).
* If GitHub id matches kth id, set a status check flag to success.
* Otherwise, check that the Member mail address in the README match, and set the status check flag to success.
* If both of the above fails, set the status check flag to failure.
* Utilize Status checks API to visualize the result.
