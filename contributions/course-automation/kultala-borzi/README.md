## Group rules for this course:
- Max 3 persons in a group 

- You cannot be with the same persons for more than 2 projects.

- You can work alone on one or at most two projects.

- When you send a pull request for registration, please follow the name convention of using the email addresses of two members to create the folder: email-email. 
    - This is assumed to be the same email addresses as specified in the readme. 

    - This is also assumed to mean “all members of the group” and not “two members”; i.e. if there are three members then all three mbemers’ email address should be included in the folder name.

## Proposal
When a new project is proposed, the readme and the folder name are checked for the names of the group members. The group validity is checked against the rules stated above and a comment with the results is posted on the PR. It also checks that the name of the folder is correct in relation to the email addresses in the readme.

## Tools:
Github Actions   
Bonus: Status Check on GitHub
