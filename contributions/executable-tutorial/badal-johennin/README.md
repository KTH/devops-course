# Executable Tutorial: Integrating Code Climate in developers workflow with shell scripts and docker

Code Climate is a lint tool that can be integrated online on github, it also has a CLI for local linting. We have created a executable tutorial of how to integrate Code Climate in a repository to build/test code for local execution. This, to enable a repository's developers to have the benefits of using a powerful linting tool without any previous experience. It can also prevent that pull requests will fail on checks which could have easily been prevented and at the same time assisting in maintaining the desired structure of the code.
