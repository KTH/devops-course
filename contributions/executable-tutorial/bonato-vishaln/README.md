## Description

CI is also becoming part of the deployment of ML models into production, in order to make the whole process smoother. 
In this tutorial we would like to show how the CML library, built specifically to implement CI/CD in ML projects, 
can be used to make CI much better, by implementing a pipeline that automatically trains the model when someone makes a PR, and returns a report
directly in the GitHub page with some graphs containing some useful metrics that are necessary to understand how well the training of the model is proceeding.
