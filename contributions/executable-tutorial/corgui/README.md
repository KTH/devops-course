## Description

Writing good commit messages is very important in a team project, but it can be a hard task. This is why commit conventions exist in order to help developper. 
In the executable tutorial, I want to create a step-by-step tutorial on how to setup a good environnement to enforce the use of [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) in a project.

If I have enough time, I could also decribe how using a commit covention can be useful in a CI pipeling, for automatic changelog and version number generation for example.
