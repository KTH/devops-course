### Proposal:
The tutorial will teach the user to integrate DataDog with an existing containerized app, using katacoda.
To do this, we will create a ”To-Do” application with a simple frontend and backend that simulates the user’s app. Also, we will explain why monitoring is important and relevant.


* The user will create a free trial account on DataDog (No credit card required)
* The user will integrate the existing application with DataDog
* The user can see logs in DataDog as traffic comes in
