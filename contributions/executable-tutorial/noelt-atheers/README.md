  - Atheer Salim (atheers@kth.se)

## Deadline
- Task 3

## Category
- Executable tutorial

## Description
We will create an executable tutorial in Killercoda that focus on using Testcontainers in python for testing a backend api. This api has a data
access layer which consist of Redis (cache) and PostgresSQL (long term storage), which we will test.  
This tutorial will be using Testcontainers to manage containers for the backend testing. Some of the learning outcomes will be that the user gets an idea of what it is and
the benifits of using Testcontainers. In addition to this the user will gain some knowledge in how to use the library.        

 **Relevance**

Testcontainers can provide complex testing envronments that are repreducable and automate the process of creating these environments. The Testcontainers can also be used to 
mock the production environments and makes it quite simple to test frontend,backend,database etc. Testcontainers makes sure that the containers
and services are up and runnig in a desired clean state. Furthermore it will perform cleanup of the containers for you.
