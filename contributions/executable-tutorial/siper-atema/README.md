## Proposal

This tutorial will guide one through how to create a K8 cluster and deploy a scheduled serverless function using Kubeless. 
The scheduled function will call an another service on the K8 cluster, with the purpose of demonstrating how this can be used to 
perform routine tasks such as backups and archiving automatically. We plan to use Katacoda to be able to run the tutorial with a bash terminal.
