## Description
We are going to integrate infracost into a CI/CD pipeline to generate real time estimates for cloud infrastrcutre. You will learn how to configure infracost and set up cost predictions within your CI/CD workflow. We will create a web project, set up a CI/CD pipleline, setup a terraform file and integrate infracost into the pipeline to monitor the infrastructure cost.

**Relevance**

This is relevant for devops beacuse by integrating infracost for develeopers it allows them to automate cost control and avoid unexpected expenses. This is useful for continuous improvment of infrastrcture by ensuring cost efficiency.
