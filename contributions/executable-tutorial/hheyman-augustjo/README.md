## Proposal:
Many tutorials teach docker in relation to other tools, but this requires an initial, basic docker and docker containers. We create a web-based tutorial on how to set up a docker container and how to configure it for specific requirements. Docker is perhaps the most popular devops tool in the world and its relevance need hardly be stated. This tutorial would aim to be a very effective crash course for our fellow students in how to get started with docker and provide a fundament for future learning.


### What the user learns:
- How to set up a docker container
- How to configure a docker container for individual needs
- Relevant inner mechanics of docker
- Different strategies of using docker effectively, adapted to context
