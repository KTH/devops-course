## Proposal:
Splunk is a popular tool that helps companies analyse streams of big data comming from security systems, tech infrastructure and other applications. Splunk makes it easy to analyse and visualize data. With the help of docker you can install splunk enterprize in a container for easy access. So our proposal is how to set up splunk in a docker container also how to configure splunk to your needs.We will try to guide the users on how the splunk interface works and how to use it to upload data and manipulate it. The tutorial is planned to be done in either Katacoda or as a blogpost.
