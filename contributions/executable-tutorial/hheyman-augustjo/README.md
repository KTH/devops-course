Splunk makes it easy to analyse and visualize data. With the help of docker you can install splunk enterprize in a container for easy access. So our proposal is how to set up splunk in a docker container also how to configure splunk to your needs. We will also show users how they can upload data and manipulate it with splunk. The tutorial is planned to be done in Katacoda.
