## Task
We want to create a katacoda tutorial on how to do continuous benchmarking using Github Actions. This will help developers easily compare benchmark results and alert on worse performance when making a new PR. The statistics will most likely be displayed as markdown on github and initialy we will use pytest for python scripts. This would be a fun project to do since it would be reusable in our other work to measure performance changes.

### If time
* Add visualization using github pages.
* Add support for more language
