## Task
This project was aimed to teach others how to set up a Github Action to create continuous benchmarking with pytest. We also added a simple visualization with Github Pages that we walk through briefly in the tutorial. 

This will help developers easily compare benchmark results and alert on worse performance when making new commits. The statistics from the latest run are found in `output.json` and the historical comparison table is visualized in the generated page available [here](https://jhammarstedt.github.io/Benchmarking-DevOps/).

## Katacoda tutorial
We have created a katacoda tutorial that runs a bash terminal and a VS code environment in the browser. It walks through every step to build and set up this repo yourself. 

You will learn how to: 
* Create simple Github Action that will let you test and compare python scripts on pushes to your GitHub repository
    * With a few modifications, you can also implement them for other tasks to enable CI/CD in your other projects!
    * You can also use this action with similar performance tools for other programming languages.
* Create your first Github Page that will display the results from your testing

    The author of the action did not support memes by repo owners, which would be a problem for our purpose. So I raised that
   <a href="https://clipart.world/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Colorful-Easter-Egg-clipart-transparent.png" target="_top">issue</a> and got a new feature merged for this tutorial 🤙
