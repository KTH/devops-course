## Task
We want to create a katacoda tutorial on how to do static code analysis using Github Actions and Linters. This will help developers make sure that their code is correctly formated before a PR can be merged, allowing programmers to follow standard programming ethics and produce better readability across teams. We aim to use kataconda to create the interactive tutorial.
