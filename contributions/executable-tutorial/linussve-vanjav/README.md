## Description

We will an executable tutorial of doing headless testing on a web browser using Selenium. We will include showing how selenium can be used to automate web actions from Python. Then we will write tests in unitest using these automated actions such as filling out forms and navigating through multiple web pages. 
We will analyze the results of the tests, and explain how these tests can be integrated in a CI/CD pipeline. The tutorial will be made using Google Colab. 

**Relevance**

Selenium is a tool that automates web actions that easily can be integrated in testing of a web app. The topic of DevOps highly regards automation, optimization and general improvements in the structure of a project. Few things align more with DevOps more than automated web testing. Considering that it is vastly beneficial for developers.
