## Proposal

I want to create a tutorial where the Jenkins tool will be set up to automatically build and deploy a simple node.js application as a Docker Image to Docker Hub. This would combine multiple relevant DevOps courses like CI/CD with Jenkins as well as containers with Docker, which are topics I would like to learn more about.

The tutorial will not be run in a web-based environment. It is intended to be run locally. The reason for this is that the tutorial is intended to be used to set up a local Jenkins environment that can be used for developing applications. It will thus be beneficial to have the resulting Jenkins Pipeline setup on your local machine. The tutorial steps will be given as an article on https://medium.com/.
