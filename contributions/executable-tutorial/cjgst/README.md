## Proposal

Pi-Hole is a service to remove advertisements by running a custom DNS server that does not resolve names that are ads or advertisement services. I plan to have a tutorial going through how to set this up using Docker and also briefly explaining the services.

I plan to use Katacoda to be able to run the tutorial interactively with a terminal and executing all the necessary steps.

## Execution

I made a tutorial and it's available at https://www.katacoda.com/christian-stj.

The repo for my tutorial can be found here: https://github.com/christian-stj/katacoda-scenarios.

## Feedback

I have received feedback from @andreaskth and @EleonoraBorzis and acted upon it, the diff can be found [here](https://github.com/christian-stj/katacoda-scenarios/commit/992a247b6f5e7350c4b5c3a9fcc1b1e98f19de04).
