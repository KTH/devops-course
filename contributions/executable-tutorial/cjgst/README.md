## Proposal

Pi-Hole is a service to remove advertisements by running a custom DNS server that does not resolve names that are ads or advertisement services. I plan to have a tutorial going through how to set this up using Docker and also briefly explaining the services.

I plan to use Katacoda to be able to run the tutorial interactively with a terminal and executing all the necessary steps.
