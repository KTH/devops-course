## Description

It is definitely a struggle when you go live far away from your much loved SSH machine. Especially when your ISP decides to change your public IP address once every two weeks. After the IP address changes, normally you would have no way to know the new one if you don't have a registration to a DNS service. But what if you don't want to use a DNS service? Here I'll show you how to solve the problem in a completely autonomous way.
