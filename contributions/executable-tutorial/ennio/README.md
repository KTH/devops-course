## Description

It is definitely a struggle when you go live far away from your much loved SSH machine. Especially when your ISP decides to change your public IP address once every two weeks. After the IP address changes, normally you would have no way to know the new one if you don't have a registration to a DNS service. But what if you don't want to use a DNS service? Here I'll show you how to solve the problem in a completely autonomous way.

**Final Submission**: [Tutorial repo](https://github.com/enniorampello/ip-address-email)

**Changes after feedback**:
1. updated explanation on what to fill in the fields like `<any-email-address>`.

2. updated script to send email so that it executes correctly.

3. commented all the different parts of the final script so that its purpose is more clear.
