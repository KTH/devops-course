## Proposal
I will create a [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/) executable tutorial including:
* Creating a simple C++ project
* Writing unit tests using the CxxTest framework 
* Creating a Travis CI server 
* Creating a CI pipeline that automatically builds and tests the project on every push

## Katacoda link 
The tutorial can be found here: [link](https://www.katacoda.com/kalpet/scenarios/repeat-executable-tutorial)
