## Description
OpenFaas is an open-source framework for deploying event-driven functions and microservices to Kubernetes. You can use it to run Serverless functions on any cloud without being locked-in to third party vendors.
In this executable tutorial, we are going to set up OpenFaas, create and deploy our first Serverless function and try to add auto-scalling.
