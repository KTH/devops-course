## Proposal

The functional programming language Clojure allows easy execution of scripts with its built-in REPL. The library AWS-api makes it easy to use the AWS tools from Clojure. AWS APIs operations are described in data that can be used recursively, this makes AWS very well suited for a fundamentally functional programming language such as Clojure. Combinated with Clojure, this library is a powerful alternative to AWS CLI and bash scripts to access the tools of AWS. In this executable tutorial, we would explain how to use the library to access AWS Services.
