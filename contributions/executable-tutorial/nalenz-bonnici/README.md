Executable tutorial

## Description

When companies grow, they often face the requirement of having full control over their Source Code Management tool, so it is not possible anymore to use github.com or gitlab.com. Instead, this service needs to be hosted in their own infrastructure, e.g. to enforce certain company policies regarding access control or to be able to determine the server location.

This executable tutorial should showcase how the platform GitLab can be installed in a newly set up AWS infrastructure. It will move through all the setup and configuration required for the GitLab instance to be fully usable and will give a quick overview of possible next steps and which additional features the paid version of GitLab offers.
