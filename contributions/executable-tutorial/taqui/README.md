## Proposal
I want to create an Executable Tutorial for creating a CI/CD pipeline for a Kubernetes Cluster. The frontend will be super simple with a counter and click function.

The current structure of the tutorial:

- Creating the initial frontend, set up frontend with simple tests
- Creating a small cluster
- Containerizing the frontend
- Deploying the frontend to a small pod
- Creating the CI/CD pipeline
- Make changes to the frontend and actually push it to master
- Check that the CI/CD pipeline works correctly and then make sure that the deployed website works correctly
