## Proposal

We would like to create an executable tutorial on Katacoda that will showcase how to add support for monitoring/analytics in an application by using the ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana). We will create our own very basic application and extend it with monitoring/analytics.

As for the actual analytics to focus on, it remains to be determined when we've learned more about the capabilities of the ELK stack. Most likely we want to focus on generating and displaying data on how users interact with the application (which elements the user interacts with most, which views are most frequently visited, and how much time is spent in each view).

The relationship to DevOps is that monitoring is a big part of "Ops" and a lot can be gained by automating this as much as possible. Also [this](https://www.atlassian.com/devops/devops-tools/devops-monitoring?) reference contains good motivations for why/how this is related to DevOps.
