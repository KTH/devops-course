## Content

TeamCity is a great CI/CD tool and Docker is a open platform for containerizing, which strongly related 
to DevOps.

We have wrote a blog on Dev.to [here](https://dev.to/chenzidi/run-teamcity-on-docker-5f8b). As explained in the
blog, our tutorial can be executed on the web browser by [Play-With-Docker](https://labs.play-with-docker.com/#).
This is a free online tool. Readers need to register to use this tool.
 
## Our target:


|  criteria   | what we do  |
|  ----  | ----  |
| successfully execute all the commands | yes, also in browser |
| run on Linux  | easy to setup and run |
| gives enough background  | comprehensive background  |
| easy to follow  | well documented  |
| contains easter eggs | yes, we have three tips to show interesting things |
| language is correct  | yes |
| The tutorial is successful (attracts comments and success)  | yes* |

* We tried to make our tutorial published in [play-with-docker classroom](https://training.play-with-docker.com/alacart/).
In order to do that, we created a pull request in the [official repo](https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker.github.io) #219, 
so that the responsible workers could review our tutorial. And they thought our tutorial is useful and they would included in the PWD classroom.
You can see the comment from responsible workers from [here](https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker.github.io/pull/219).
And we get 2 hearts and 2 unicorn in dev.to.
