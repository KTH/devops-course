## Proposal

I would like to write a toturial on katacoda. 
The idea is to have a small scenario to integrate TeamCity with Docker.
TeamCity is a powerful CI tool, so it should fit the purpose of the course.
By the way, I am new to Docker and TeamCity, so if there are more suggestions, 
please tell me :)
