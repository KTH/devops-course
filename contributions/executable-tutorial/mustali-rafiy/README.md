## Category

Executable tutorial 

## Description

The idea is to create a executuble tutorial that teaches testing and the importance of testing in repositories. Why testing is used, how it's used and why it should be used. The tutorial is going to be going throught the basics of testing and an implementation of unittests will be required to complete the tutorial. The tutorial will be online on katakoda.com. The tutorial will be in the programming language python as it is what the most often used in the real world.

We plan on using Katacoda to step through the tutorial interactively and execute the necessary steps that we detailed above.
