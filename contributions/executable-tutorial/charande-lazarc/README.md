## Relevance to DevOps
Continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment/delivery (CD) are fundamental
tools for DevOps development. CI is an automated way for continuously merging and testing
software code, while CD is by continuously make deliveries of software functionality in so-called deployments. 
The difference between continuous deployment and delivery is that continuous deployment is actually 
deployed, while continuous delivery is not. 

## Originality

There are no awesome tutorials on Katacoda that illustrates how to create a CI/CD on GitLab. 
Although, CI/CD are common tools that are used by many software developers, along with many
types of DevOps tools. We are planning to use GitLab (Tech stack) own internal CI/CD server in order to automatize an already existing project (to be chosen soon).
