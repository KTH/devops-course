Task 4

## Category

Executable tutorial 

## Description

Dhall is a programmable configuration language. Which can be used either as the main configruation langugage or it can be converted to other common formats, such as, json, yaml, etc. In this executable tutorial I plan to give an introduction to dhall and its features, its advantages compared to other configuration lanugages (or programming langugages) and its integration into a project. The tutorial will include how to use dhall with a programming language like python or java. Katacoda will be used to execute the tutorial.
