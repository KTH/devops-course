## Description

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the managing and provisioning of infrastructure through code instead of through manual processes. Ansible is an automation tool that helps people perform IaC. 

We want to create a Kataconda to show how to use an Ansible Playbook to automate the deployment of MERN (a very common tech stack consisting of MongoDB, Express, React, Node) to AWS EC2 instances.
