## Description

This tutorial will explain step by step how to create a dashboard in Splunk. We will start by generating some data input in the form of logs to use in the dashboard and visualize the data in real-time. For our tutorial the dashboard will focus on showing information such as build times, success rates and error messages for a build job. Lastly we will also show how you can set up alerts based on certain conditions.

If we find more appropriate Splunk dashboard features we can add these to the tutorial.

**Relevance**

Dashboards are used to convert logs into a easily readable format. This can be helpful for developers to understand the result of builds and tests faster. When monitoring logs in real time alerts can be useful for triggering new actions, or to alert developers that a something has happened in the logs.
