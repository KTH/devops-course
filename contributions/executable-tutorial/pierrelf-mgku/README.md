## Description

In this tutorial, we will present how to trace and profile a web application using OpenTelemetry and Jaeger. OpenTelemetry is an observability framework that provides APIs and libraries for capturing distributed traces and metrics from applications. Jaeger is a distributed tracing system that helps visualize and analyze trace data. By following this tutorial, you will gain hands-on experience in instrumenting a sample application, generating traces, and analyzing trace data to optimize performance and identify bottlenecks.

**Relevance**

Tracing and profiling with OpenTelemetry and Jaeger are relevant to DevOps as they enable the monitoring and optimization of application performance throughout the development lifecycle. This facilitates collaboration between development and operations teams, ensuring deployment of applications while maintaining high availability and user satisfaction.
