## Description

Devbox is a command-line tool that lets you easily create isolated shells for development. You start by defining the list of packages required for your project, and Devbox creates an isolated, reproducible environment with those packages installed. We will create a tutorial that explains how to use Devbox to manage project dependencies. The tutorial will cover the following topics:
- Why devbox is useful
- How to install dependencies with devbox
- How to create scripts in devbox
- How to replicate the same environment in your CI/CD pipeline with GH Actions

**Relevance**

Devbox is relevant to DevOps as it simplifies creating reproducible development environments, ensuring consistency across local, testing, and production setups. This aligns with DevOps principles, improving collaboration, automation, and the reliability of CI/CD pipelines.
