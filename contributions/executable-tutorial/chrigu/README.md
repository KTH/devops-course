## Proposal

I want to create a tutorial where the Jenkins tool will be set up to automatically build and deploy a simple node.js application as a Docker Image to Docker Hub. This would combine multiple relevant DevOps courses like CI/CD with Jenkins as well as containers with Docker, which are topics I would like to learn more about.

The plan right now is to use https://www.katacoda.com/ for the tutorial.
