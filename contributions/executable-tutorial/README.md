### Proposal
Goal of this tutorial is to show how to set up Ansible to automate infrastructure for Jenkins and Kubernetes for application deployment.
I have no prior experience with any of those tools and want to use this tutorial as a chance to dive into them.

The tutorial will be hosted on [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com).
