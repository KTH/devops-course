# Description
Gradle is a build automation tool that is used in the development process with everything from compilation to testing and deployment. It can be used cross-language and is very versatile, it systemizes the delivery of your software. Combining the test functionalities of gradle with Github Actions we can setup a simple yet powerful CI/CD Pipeline

We will create a katacoda tutorial which teaches the student how to setup this automated build enviroment through interactive steps.
