## Description
This tutorial will be made in KillerKoda. First there will be an introduction to Configuration Management (CM) and Ansible, as well as what it can be used for. Since CM is often used in the military, the theme of this tutorial will be military weapon systems. More specifically, the user will set up two servers for a missile launch system, one of them being a backup. Then, (totally unexpectedly) a missile launch will be activated and the user most act quickly to abort the launch. To achieve this, Disaster Recovery has to be activated, where the backup server will come to use. 

**Relevance**
CM tools are crucial for DevOps environments since they make it possible to configure the environments via scripts. CM can have great benefits, and is not that costly to implement. Therefore, it's important to have knowledge in how to set up CM tools. And Ansible is one of these tools. The benefits of CM becomes evident due to the fact that it enables Disaster Recovery to be implemented to a project, which can potentially save companies in case emergency strikes. And that is why Disaster Recovery is relevant to CM and DevOps as a whole.
