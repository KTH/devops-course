## Description

Stryker Mutator is a tool where you are able to test how relevant your own tests that you creat are towards detecting bugs. We plan on creating a tutorial that shows how to set up Stryker Mutator on your own machine, explain the services Stryker Mutator provides, and give an simple example of Stryker Mutator in use.

We plan on using Katacoda to step through the tutorial interactively and execute the necessary steps that we detailed above. We will voice over what we are doing to create a tutorial that is easy for the user to follow.
