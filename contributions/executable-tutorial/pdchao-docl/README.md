## Description

Stryker Mutator is a tool where you are able to test how relevant your own tests that you creat are towards detecting bugs. We plan on creating a tutorial that shows how to set up Stryker Mutator on your own machine, explain the services Stryker Mutator provides, and give an simple example of Stryker Mutator in use.

We plan on using Katacoda to step through the tutorial interactively and execute the necessary steps that we detailed above. We will voice over what we are doing to create a tutorial that is easy for the user to follow. 

## Proposal/motivation
Mutation testing is an important part for ensuring that your test suite is robust and thorough.

We created a Katacoda Tutorial to teach the user about the Stryker Mutator tool and how to implement it into their own project. 

<br>

<strong>Our tutorial consists of:</strong>

<ol>
 <li>Introduction to mutation testing and Stryker Mutator</li>
 <li>How to install Stryker Mutator into your project</li>
 <li>How to configure Stryker Mutator to your needs</li>
 <li>Learn how to navigate Stryker Mutator Report</li>
 <li>Takeaways</li>
</ol>
