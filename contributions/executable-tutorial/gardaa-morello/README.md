## Description
In this tutorial, we want to show how to trace system calls in Python using Ptracer, which is a libabry developed by Pinterest to more efficiently trace their code base. 

**Relevance**
Tracing is an important in DevOps as it helps figuring out where failures and bugs occur, in order to fix them and cause optimal performance. Other tracing libraries, such as Strace, does not provide any information about where an event happens in the code. Ptracer solves this, making it less of a hassle to find bugs and failures in a Python codebase.
