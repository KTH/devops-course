## Proposal

We want to show how to create a Docker image that runs an FTP server (vsftpd).
The goal of the tutorial is to teach how to set up a Docker container, expose 
Docker container ports and teach the basics of how FTP works.

## Submission

Here is the link to the initial proposal PR https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/pull/1343

Our tutorial can be run in the browser and is available [here](https://katacoda.com/mansand/scenarios/dockerized_ftp_server)

The source of the tutorial can be found in the repository https://github.com/mansand1/katacoda-scenarios
