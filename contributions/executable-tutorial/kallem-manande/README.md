## Proposal

An executable tutorial running on Katacoda, where we show how to set up
a Node web server using Express that serves a website with some images. 

We then show how to configure and create a Docker image that runs the 
web server and is able to serve the website through port 80.

At the end the person running the tutorial is able to open up the
website and see the result of their creation.
