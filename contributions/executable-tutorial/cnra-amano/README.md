## Description
In this tutorial, we will explain what Policy as Code and Kubewarden are, and why they are important for Kubernetes environments. We will walk through the process of implementing and enforcing policies using Kubewarden in a Kubernetes cluster. Additionally, we will write a policy using Rego and deploy it to the cluster, demonstrating how policies can be automated and integrated seamlessly into DevOps workflows.


 **Relevance**


Policy as Code is crucial for maintaining consistency, security, and compliance in Kubernetes environments, making it a core practice in modern DevOps. Kubewarden provides a powerful and flexible way to implement and enforce these policies.
