# Proposal
A Katacoda tutorial with the goal to teach the user how to set up an test-environment for React-Redux projects using Jest, Selenium, and LambdaTest.

The user will learn how to write unit, intergration, and e2e tests, aswell as getting a better understanding of why it is important and relevant to have a good test coverage.
