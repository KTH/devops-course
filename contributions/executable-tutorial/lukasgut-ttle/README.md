## Description

CUE (#2), which stands for Configure, Unify and Execute, is a configuration language that was made to reduce the amount of mistakes made when creating configuration files. It calls itself a superset of JSON, and works primarily by creating restraints on data, which can then be exported to e.g. a JSON or a YAML file. We want to make an executable tutorial that covers the basics of using CUE, that hopefully will be easy to follow and open people up to using and learning more about CUE.
