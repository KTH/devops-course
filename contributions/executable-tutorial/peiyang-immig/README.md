## Description

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on using Sampler to visualize data from databases including MySQL, PostgreSQL and MongoDB. The tutorial covers the installation and setup of Sampler, configuration of database, and creating a YAML configuration file to visualize various metrics such as the number of records, data insertion rate, and database size. By using Sampler, users can create real-time terminal-based dashboards that offer insights into their database's performance and status.

The tutorial will demonstrate how to configure different visual components like barcharts, runcharts, sparklines, and textboxes to provide a comprehensive view of database metrics. This executable tutorial is designed to give users practical experience in setting up and using Sampler to monitor and visualize their databases effectively.

**Relevance**

 Sampler is a lightweight, terminal-based visualization tool that can be easily set up without the complexity of traditional monitoring systems. This tutorial will show how to leverage Sampler to create a customizable and interactive dashboard that helps users gain insights into their database's performance, making it easier to identify and troubleshoot issues. This aligns with the DevOps principles of observability and monitoring, enabling teams to maintain high levels of service quality and system reliability.
