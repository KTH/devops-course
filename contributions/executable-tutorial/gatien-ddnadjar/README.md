Executable tutorial

## Description  

We plan on creating an executable tutorial that teaches the user how to setup a discord bot thanks to discord.py librairy. We'll explain how to add commands and give roles when a new user joins. We will also explain how to link the discord bot to the Github API to receive, for example, an alert every time a new PR is created in this repository.
