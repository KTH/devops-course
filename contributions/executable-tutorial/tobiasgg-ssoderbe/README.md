## Deadline

Task 2

## Category

Executable tutorial

## Description

In general, large software projects are split up into smaller modules that can be deployed on different containers. Since integration testing is an important part of testing the quality of software, being able to test different containers in unison is very important. This tutorial aims to show how this can be done using Docker and the python package `testcontainers`. 


The tutorial will show how testing can be performed using two simple python applications on separate containers along with installation of the package.
