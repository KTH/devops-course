## Description
Semgrep is a light weighted and efficient static code analysis tool. We will use Killercoda to demonstrate what Semgrep CLI can achieve and how you can apply the tool to your own CI/CD pipeline. The tutorial consists of 5 steps:
1. Install Semgrep and download the example codebase (here we use the famous vulnerable web application `juice-box`)
2. Use Semgrep CLI to scan the codebase with default Semgrep Registry rules and examine the warnings
3. Use Semgrep as a Docker container in a CI/CD pipeline
4. Learn how to define customized Semgrep rules
5. Conclusion

**Relevance**

Static code analysis is an essential part of an efficient CI/CD pipeline. It inspects code to identify defects, vulnerabilities and compliance issues, accelerating software delivery, and Semgrep is such a light weighted and efficient option and is actively being developed. In any case, Semgrep also having the ability to be used as a Docker image helps you create more secure applications through automated static analysis scanning alongside the scanning of your pipeline files in the near future, given successful ongoing development!
