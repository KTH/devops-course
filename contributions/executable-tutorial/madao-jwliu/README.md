# Assignment Proposal

## Title
Gitguardian: A Real-time Git Repo Secret Detector

## Names and KTH ID
Minh Allan Dao (madao@ug.kth.se)
Jun-Wei Liu (jwliu@kth.se)

## Deadline
Task 3

## Category
Online tutorial

## Description
We will use Killercoda, an educational browser-based Linux environment, to demonstrate how to set up Gitguardian and use it to monitor an example codebase with common key-exposed scenarios (API keys, passwords, certificates). Readers of this tutorial can connect to the Killercoda scenario we created with the browser to learn how Gitguardian works hand-by-hand without the troubles of setting up the environment.

**Relevance**
It's common that developers unintentionally expose secrets in their codebase, making their application at high security risk. Gitguardian as an extension to the codebase monitors any new git commits in real-time.
