## Description

Gradle is a build automation tool that is used in the development process with everything from compilation to testing and deployment. It can be used cross-language and is very versatile, it systemises the delivery of your software. Combining the test functionalities of Gradle with Github Actions we can setup a simple yet powerful CI/CD Pipeline

We will create a Katacoda tutorial which teaches the student how to setup this automated build environment through interactive steps.
