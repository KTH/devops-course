# Executable Tutorial

## Description

We created an executable tutorial with Katacoda which teaches how to setup a Gradle project for build and test automation. It also teaches how to add unit and integration tests, and how to combine this with GitHub actions to create a CI/CD pipeline. It also explains the basics of how Maven can be combined with gradle to publish a Gradle artifact to a Maven repository.

It consists of the following parts:

* Introduction to Gradle
* Introduction to GitHub Actions
* Setting up a project with Gradle
* Adding unit and integration tests
* Setting up CI pipeline with GitHub actions
* Using Maven to publish a Gradle artifact
