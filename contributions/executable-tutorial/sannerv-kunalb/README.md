## Description

Gradle is a build automation tool that is used in the development process with everything from compilation to testing and deployment. It can be used cross-language and is very versatile, it systemises the delivery of your software. Combining the test functionalities of Gradle with Github Actions we can setup a simple yet powerful CI/CD Pipeline

We will create a Katacoda tutorial which teaches the student how to setup this automated build environment through interactive steps.

***SUBMISSION***

We created an executable tutorial with Katacoda which teaches how to setup a Gradle project for build and test automation. It also teaches how to add unit and integration tests, and how to combine this with GitHub actions to create a CI/CD pipeline. It also explains the basics of how Maven can be combined with gradle to publish a Gradle artifact to a Maven repository.

It consists of the following parts:

* Introduction to Gradle
* Introduction to GitHub Actions
* Setting up a project with Gradle
* Adding unit and integration tests
* Setting up CI pipeline with GitHub actions
* Using Maven to publish a Gradle artifact
