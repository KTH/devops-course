## Description

The executable tutorial will provide a hands-on guide to implementing automated API testing using FastAPI, Starlette TestClient and Git Hooks. Consequently, the tutorial is going to cover the following topics:

- Setting up the required tools in the environment and creating a git repository
- Initializing a sample FastAPI project and running the API with Uvicorn
- Reviewing provided test cases for the sample API.
- Configuring Git Hooks to run provided Starlette TestClient test cases in automatic manner.
- Updating source code of the API
- Automation and regression testing of the new changes to the API

**Relevance**

Automation of testing is essential in DevOps, since it largely reduces the time taken to manually find pre-existing bugs, as well as significantly lowers the risk of accidentally introducing new ones. Moreover, this is especially vital in the area of API testing, in order to avoid regression bugs and ensure consistent performance and reliability across different environments and versions.
