## Description

In our tutorial we will show how to set up a demo for your Vue web service using the pages function of GitHub combined with how to set up a github Action workflow to deploy it. In this specific example we will be using Vue since we have used it in previous computer science courses at KTH. The tutorial is aimed to give you a working Vue bootstrap that is available for others to test online without having to find a hosting solution.

The technical changes needed compared to a regular Jekyll github pages page, is creating a .yml to build vue, changing the routing of your vue application to use hash routing instead and deploying a correct file structure to a separate branch.


**Relevance**

Being able to give others access is a very useful tool in the beginning of creating a web service. Not having to spend time on setting up back-end solutions and instead being able to focus on working out features. Using github pages is according to us one of the simplest solutions for doing this and unlike Canva Pro and Adobe XD also available for free.
