Executable tutorial

## Description

In modern large scale software development projects stakeholder management is a vital aspect of the development process.
DevOps as a concept is something that may be utilized to benefit an organization in more ways than the purely technical.
We propose an executable tutorial where we show how to automate GitHub performance reports in a clean and graphical manner using Google Colab.

The output of this project is a Google Colab notebook that produces a formatted report ready for export to the appropriate stakeholders.
In our opinion, this fits under the category of "software bots" in the DevOps course.
