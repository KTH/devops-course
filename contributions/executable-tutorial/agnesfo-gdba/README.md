## Members

## Proposal:
The tutorial will teach the user to create and connect a Travis CI with a React project, using katacoda to show how to do it.
The React app will be a basic web application however there will be a focus in React tests to be incorporated to the CI server.
There will also be an explanation to why testing is important to the DevOps practices and how to check the tests.


## Final submission
The tutorial can be found at Katacoda [**here**](https://www.katacoda.com/agnesforsberg/scenarios/travis-ci-with-react-testing).

The Katacoda repo is [**here**](https://github.com/agnesforsberg/katacoda-scenarios).

The tutorial application repo is [**here**](https://github.com/agnesforsberg/travis-react-tutorial).
