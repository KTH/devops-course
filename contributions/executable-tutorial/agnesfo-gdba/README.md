## Members

## Proposal:
The tutorial will teach the user to create and connect a Travis CI with a React project, using katacoda to show how to do it.
The React app will be a basic web application however there will be a focus in React tests to be incorporated to the CI server.
There will also be an explanation to why testing is important to the DevOps practices and how to check the tests.


The user will also get a chance to see how travis reacts to failed tests and how that affects the work in a DevOps environment.

### What the user learns:
* how to authorize Travis to work with their github account
* how to implement Travis CI to a React project and how it works
* how to write simple tests in React
* how to view test results using a CI server
