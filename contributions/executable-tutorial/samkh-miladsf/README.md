## Description

In this tutorial we will set up a python script that logs a ML models predictions. 
This is integrated with Prometheus which will mointor them. 
The goal is to learn how to integrate Prometheus with a Python application, which is then will be able to monitor the model to understand if it for example will work well when put into production.

 **Relevance**

Monitoring ML model prediction with Prometheus is highly relevant to DevOps because it introduces automation and observability to the machine learning lifecycle. 
In DevOps, ensuring that systems are continously monitored for performance and reliability is crucial and this extends to machine learning models in production. 
By integrating Prometheus to track metrics like prediction accuracy or latency, teams can proactively identify issues to reduce downtime and improve model reliability.
