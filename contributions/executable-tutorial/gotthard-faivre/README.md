## Proposal

We intend to create a step-by-step tutorial on how you could potentially optimize a GitHub Actions pipeline in terms of execution time for a `node.js` application. The idea is to start with a *naive* and slow pipeline and iteratively apply optimizations to it and measure the improvement in execution time.
