## Description

We will introduce how to use Skaffold for automating build, push, and deployment in a local Kubernetes cluster (Minikube). We plan to create a simple application, write its Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifest, and use Skaffold to streamline development. 

**Relevance**

Skaffold can simplify the CI/CD process and speed up deployment, making it easier to modify and debug configurations.
