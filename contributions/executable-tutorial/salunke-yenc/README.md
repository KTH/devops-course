## Description
For an application, it is important for us to determine performance metrics and monitor events for infrastructure and cloud services.

Datadog is an observability service for cloud-scale applications, providing monitoring of servers, databases, tools, and services, through a SaaS-based data analytics platform. ([Reference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datadog))

We plan to create a tutorial to show how to use Datadog to monitor applications deployed on Heroku.
