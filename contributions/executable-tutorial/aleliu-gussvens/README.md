## Description

In our tutorial we will show how to set up a slack bot using node.js to monitor GitHub actions through notification in a slack channel. The bot will be able to parse github logs into readable slack messages in order to simplify continuous development and monitoring.

**Relevance**

Effective monitoring and automation is crucial to the DevOps life cycle. By integrating slack bot with GitHub actions developers can get real-time status updates on ongoing processes directly in their slack workspace. Additionally, developers can trigger pre-defined common events through slack increasing the efficiency of the entire process. The use of slack streamlines the continuous devlopment and monitoring process for developers and is a critical part in the DevOps cycle.
