## Proposal
 
Provide short tutorial on how CI/CD pipelines could be used to provide environment that could be used for testing purpose

- Establishing simple CI/CD pipeline (that runs some basic tests)
- Adding A/B testing environments (by deploying docker containers to linux machine)
- Showcasing how this approach can lead to a better performing product (using only the best performing features based on the analyzed usage)
