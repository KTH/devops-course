## Proposal:
This tutorial will show you how to set up CI for a Python project with unittest tests and linter using Github Actions.
The code base will be simple.
There will also be a section about why CI is good.
We plan writing it on medium.com

Our previous PR (#1214) was not approved, so we changed to Python and hope that it is okay.
