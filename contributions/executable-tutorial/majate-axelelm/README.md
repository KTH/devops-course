## Proposal:
This tutorial will show you how to set up CI for a Python project with unittest tests and linter using Github Actions.
The code base will be simple.
There will also be a section about why CI is good.
We plan writing it on medium.com

Our previous PR (#1214) was not approved, so we changed to Python and hope that it is okay.

## Execution
The tutorial is available [here](https://github.com/elmaxe/devops-tutorial#readme).

## Grading
We are aiming to fulfill the following criteria:

|                                             | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|-------------------------------------------- | ----|----|-------------|
|The TA can successful execute all the commands of the tutorial (mandatory) | Yes ✅ | No | In the browser |
|If local execution, runs on Linux | Yes ✅ | No | Easy to setup and run ✅  |
|The tutorial gives enough background | Yes ✅ | No | Comprehensive background ✅ |
|The tutorial is easy to follow  | Yes ✅ | No | Well documented ✅ |
|The tutorial is original, no such tutorial exists on the web | Yes | No | The teaching team never heard about it |
|The tutorial contains [easter eggs](https://github.com/OrkoHunter/python-easter-eggs) | Yes✅ | No | Subtle and fun ✅ |
|The tutorial is successful (attracts comments and success) | Yes | No | Lively discussion |
|The language is correct | Yes ✅ | No | Interesting narrative  |

The "easter egg" can be found by checking the app.py file. It contains references to pop-culture phenomenons.

## Changes after feedback
- Grammar fixes
- Clarified how sub tests work
- Added note about enabling Actions when forking
- Added note about default branch names
