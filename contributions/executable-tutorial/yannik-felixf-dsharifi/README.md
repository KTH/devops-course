# Pijul: Haunting Git at night

[Pijul](https://pijul.org/) is a new version control system, designed with a different mindset than git. Instead of being snapshot based it manages commits as a set of sound patches. As such it allows for greater flexibility and ease of use while also providing the performance commonly accredited to to snapshot based VCSs.

In the tutorial we will:

1. concepts
   - introduce patch-based version control
   - its differences to snapshot based version control
3. show how to install `pijul` (as of now its not yet included in most distributions)
4. compare it to `git` the de facto standard tool
   - how to clone a repo
   - tracking changes
   - ~`git branch`~ `pijul channels`
   - undoing changes
   - pushing
   - contributing
