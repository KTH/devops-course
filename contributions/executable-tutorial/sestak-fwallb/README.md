## Description
A key aspect of DevOps is automation. Ansible is used for automation of deployment and configuration management. Kubernetes is used for container orchestration. Together they can be used to automate container orchestration.
The tutorial gives an introduction to Ansible and Kubernetes (K8s), and how work together. I touches upon Ansible playbooks and inventory files, as well as Kubernetes clusters and namespaces. Lastly Ansible is used to automate the process of deploying a Docker image to Kubernetes.

## Structure of the tutorial
* Introduction, overview of Ansible and K8s, how Ansible and K8s fit into the DevOps pipeline,
* Create a cluster,
* Ansible set up,
* Create an inventory file,
* Intoduction to Ansible playbooks,
* Create a simple playbook,
* K8s and namespaces,
* Pull a Docker image,
* Deploy the Docker image to K8s using Ansible,
* Did you find the *easter egg* üê•?,
