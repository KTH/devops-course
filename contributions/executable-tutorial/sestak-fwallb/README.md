### Proposal
Goal of this tutorial is to show how to use Ansible to automate configurations of Kubernetes and container deployment.

The tutorial will be hosted on [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com).

### Structure of the tutorial

* Introduction, overview of Ansible and K8s, how Ansible and K8s fit into the DevOps pipeline.
* Ansible - set up, basic commands
* K8s - set up, test
* Automating K8s with Ansible
* Conclusion, take-away

### Reason for pivot
When we started research on previously merged proposal, we found out that the scope was too big to make it interesting and useful in the limited time for tutorial.
Because of that, we decide to focus on subset of the tools and rather talk about them in more depth.
