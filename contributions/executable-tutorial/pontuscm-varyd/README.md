## Description

Firecracker is an open source technology for creating and managing small and secure virtual machines intended for serverless computing. It enables deployment of workloads with increased security and isolation as compared to traditional virtual machines with very fast load times. We will create a Katacoda tutorial showing how to start a Firecracker microVM service locally and communicating to that using some of the functions in the included API.
