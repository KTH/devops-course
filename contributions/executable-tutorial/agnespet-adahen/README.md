# Learn to integrate Jest in your React-Redux projects
A Katakoda hosted tutorial with the goal to teach the user how to set up a test-environment for React-Redux projects using Jest. Jest is a  testing library for JavaScript code. With it, you can create, run, and structure tests. It can be installed using npm (which we will do). 

The user will learn how to write unit and integration tests, integrate them with a GitHub repository and get a better understanding of why it is important and relevant to have good test coverage.
