# Proposal
A locally hosted tutorial with the goal to teach the user how to set up a test-environment for React-Redux projects using Jest, and integrating it with the github actions pipeline.

The user will learn how to write unit and integration tests, integrate it with a github repository and get a better understanding of why it is important and relevant to have good test coverage.
