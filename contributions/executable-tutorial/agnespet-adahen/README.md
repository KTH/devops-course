# Learn to integrate Jest in your React projects
A Katakoda hosted tutorial with the goal to teach the user how to set up a test-environment for React projects using Jest. Jest is a  testing library for JavaScript code. With it, you can create, run, and structure tests. It can be installed using npm (which we will do). 

The user will not only get a better understanding of some basic testing knowledge, they will also learn how to write Snapshot, unit, mock tests and get a better idea of why it is important and relevant to have good test coverage.
