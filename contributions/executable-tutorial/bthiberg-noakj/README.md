## Description

We had a visit during one of the lectures by a [Flox](https://flox.dev/docs/) developer. Exploring this cool piece of software, we found few if any tutorials on how to use it.

This tutorial goes through the main functionality of Flox. Specifically, how to create a Flox environment for an existing project, add dependencies and search for packages, and create a service. It also goes through how the Flox manifest file works.

[The tutorial can be found on KillerCoda here.](https://killercoda.com/bjornthiberg/scenario/flox)

**Relevance**

Flox is relevant to DevOps since it allows the user to create and manageme reproducible, isolated, and portable development environments. This helps with solving the “works on my machine” DevOps problem across different testing, staging and dev environments. Flox provides a platform for managing dependencies, environments, and development tools in a containerized manner. These containerized environments can then be shared, submitted to version control, and be used as part of CI/CD pipelines.
