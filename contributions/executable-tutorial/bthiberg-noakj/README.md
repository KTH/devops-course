## Description

We had a visit during one of the lectures by a [Flox](https://flox.dev/docs/) developer. Exploring this cool piece of software, we found few if any tutorials on how to use it.

This tutorial will be inspired by the [Flox docs](https://flox.dev/docs/), and show the user how to set up and use Flox environment(s) for an existing project. The user will pull a repo (containing a Flask app), initialize a Flox environment and add another package to the environment. 

After that, we might include layering multiple environments, services, enviroonment variables, depending on what level of complexity the tutorial ends up having.

We will use KillerCoda for this.

**Relevance**

Flox is relevant to DevOps since it allows the user to create and manageme reproducible, isolated, and portable development environments. This helps with solving the “works on my machine” DevOps problem across different testing, staging and dev environments. Flox provides a platform for managing dependencies, environments, and development tools in a containerized manner. These containerized environments can then be shared, submitted to version control, and be used as part of CI/CD pipelines.
