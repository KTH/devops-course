## Description

We had a visit during one of the lectures by a [flox](https://flox.dev/docs/) developer. Exploring this cool piece of software, we found few if any tutorials on how to use it.

This tutorial will be inspired by the [Flox docs](https://flox.dev/docs/), and show the user how to set up and use Flox environment(s) for an existing full-stack project that we will provide.

We might also include layering multiple environments, depending on if the the tutorial ends up being complex enough without it or not.

We will use KillerConda for this.

**Relevance**

The idea of Flox is to simplify creating reproducible, isolated, and portable development environments across different stages of the software lifecycle, ensuring consistency. I.e. very DevOps-y.
