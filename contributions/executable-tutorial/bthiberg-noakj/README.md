## Description

We had a visit during one of the lectures by a [Flox](https://flox.dev/docs/) developer. Exploring this cool piece of software, we found few if any tutorials on how to use it.

This tutorial will be inspired by the [Flox docs](https://flox.dev/docs/), and show the user how to set up and use Flox environment(s) for an existing project. The user will pull a repo (containing a Flask app), initialize a Flox environment and add another package to the environment. 

After that, we might include layering multiple environments, services, enviroonment variables, depending on what level of complexity the tutorial ends up having.

We will use KillerCoda for this.

**Relevance**

The idea of Flox is to simplify creating reproducible, isolated, and portable development environments across different stages of the software lifecycle. I.e. very DevOps-y.
