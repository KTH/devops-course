## Description

Reference to original proposal #1759 

We would like to create a tutorial in Katacoda that shows how to create an Express server as well as to containerise with the help of Docker. The tutorial will explain basic concepts of building an Express server with Node.js with the required steps for it to work properly. Then, we will show how to deploy the application with Docker. The guide will contain an explanation of what Docker is and how it works, with explanations of how to configure a Dockerfile, explain what images and containers are, and the commands to demonstrate it. Additionally, we will address the most common commands used within Docker, such as run, build, ps, exec, etc,.
