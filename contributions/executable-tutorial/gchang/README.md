# Executable Tutorial: Set Up a Unity Project with Automated Unit Testing using GitLab CI/CD

In this tutorial you will learn how to set up a basic Unity project with automated unit testing by using Gitlab CI/CD. By the end of this tutorial, you will have an environment ready so that every time a change is made to your project/repository, Gitlab CI/CD will automatically run Unity tests to verify these changes in the project.

In the tutorial you will learn:

- How to set up a Gitlab project repository
- Create a Unity project with tests that later will be run automatically
- How to install and register a Gitlab Runner on your own machine. 
- How to set up Gitlab CI/CD so that it automatically runs the Unity tests in the project whenever a change has been made to the project.
