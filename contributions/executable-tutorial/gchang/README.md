## Proposal
Automating your testing each time the code is integrated will allow you to find bugs as early as possible and fix them faster.


I plan to do a tutorial on Medium going through how to set up a Unity project and use GitLab CI/CD for automated testing.


In the tutorial you will learn:

- Setup a Gitlab project repo
- Create a Unity project with tests that later will be run automatically
- How to setup Gitlab CI/CD and how to navigate it
- How to register your own machine as CI runner in your project
- How to connect Unity with Gitlab CI/CD so that it automatically runs the tests in the project on every push
