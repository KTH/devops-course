## Proposal
I will create a [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/) executable tutorial including:
* How to write a simple python project.
* How to write unit tests with Pytest.
* How to create a Travis CI server and connect it with the Github repo.
* How to create a CI workflow that build and test automatically on every push.
