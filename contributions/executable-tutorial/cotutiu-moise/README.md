## Content
Executable tutorial (via Katacoda) showing how to configure and provision an nginx web server on a vagrant box, using a Vagrantfile.  
This is aimed at showing how to quickly deploy (previously configured) applications in virtual environments running Linux,  
providing further insight into system management and administration.

## Easter egg
We included an easter egg in our tutorial. Whenever the user mistypes a command, the following message will be displayed:

"Can you even like, type?"

This is just a more funny *and les aggressive) way of pointing out a typing error than "bash: command not found".
