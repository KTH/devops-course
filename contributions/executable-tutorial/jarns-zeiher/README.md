Simple End to End GitOps with Werf

## Names and KTH ID
  - Jonathan Arns (jarns@kth.se)
  - Fabian Zeiher (zeiher@kth.se)

## Deadline
- Task 2

## Category
- Executable tutorial

## Description
Our tutorial will show how to setup and use a simple GitOps pipeline using Werf.
We will use a small Rust web-app from a personal side-project as the application in this tutorial.

**Relevance**
GitOps is obviously relevant to the course.
Using a small, but real application will make for a nice tutorial that will enable students to
start using GitOps (and Werf) in their own projects.


**Submission**
Our finished tutorial on the topic is available [here](https://killercoda.com/jarns-zeiher/scenario/Simple-End-to-End-GitOps-with-Werf) on Katacoda.
It is the only tutorial on Katacoda about werf.
Our GitHub repo for that contains the tutorial is [here](https://github.com/cetceeve/Simple-End-to-End-GitOps-with-Werf).
