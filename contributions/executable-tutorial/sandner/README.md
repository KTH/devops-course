## Description

This tutorial, implemented in Katacoda, aims to teach you how to use lnav, to view and parse your logs into a more managable data-format.<br>
With lnav you can execute sql-like queries in your console to filter your logs to make sense of them.<br>
It parses most logs automatically, so you have field names and values for each log file. <br>
You can store the parsed and filtered logs in widely used formats like csv or json for further processing in other applications.<br>
