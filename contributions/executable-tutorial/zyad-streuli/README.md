## Description

This tutorial walks you through setting up **OPA Gatekeeper** to enforce Kubernetes policies, focusing on the creation of custom rules to govern cluster resources. You will learn to install Gatekeeper, define policies, and test them in a Kubernetes environment using tools like **Constraint Templates** and **Constraints**.

**Relevance**
OPA Gatekeeper is essential in modern DevOps for automating security and compliance across Kubernetes clusters. It enables teams to enforce consistent policies at scale, ensuring resources meet security standards, improving governance, and integrating seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines. This reduces manual intervention and risk, aligning with DevOps principles of automation and continuous security.
