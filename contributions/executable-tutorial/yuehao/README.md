## Proposal

Container not always be Docker! Try Systemd-nspawn now!  

"systemd-nspawn may be used to run a command or OS in a light-weight namespace container."

I would like to show a totural about how to creat and setup a systemd-nspawn container on linux.

I will try to use katacoda platform firstly, if it can not provide a needed environment. I will write a local totural and post on my blog.
