# Proposal
Before pushing changes to the model, it is important to evaluate the model against certain datasets. For a given pull-request, we aim to compare the current version performance versus the version on the master branch. Hopefully, commenting the results on the pull-request itself with relevant statistics (classification rate etc.). 

Our executable tutorial will contain the following:
1. Github Webhooks - Check if an pull-request has been made.
2. DIY Server - Create an environment that evaluates the model with the proposed changes given in the pull-request.
3. Use the Github API  to make a comment on the pull request with the established classification rate.
