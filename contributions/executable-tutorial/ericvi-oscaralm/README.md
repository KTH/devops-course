# Proposal
Before pushing changes to the model, it is important to evaluate the model against certain datasets. For a given pull-request, we aim to compare the current version performance versus the version on the master branch. Hopefully, commenting the results on the pull-request itself with relevant statistics (classification rate etc.). 

Our executable tutorial will contain the following:
1. Github Webhooks - Check if an pull-request has been made.
2. DIY Server - Create an environment that evaluates the model with the proposed changes given in the pull-request.
3. Use the Github API  to make a comment on the pull request with the established classification rate.

# Submission

Here is the tutorial in written form as stated in the contract.

We decided to extend our submission, by making the written tutorial interactive, to make it easier for TAs to grade and the possiblity of getting distinction.
