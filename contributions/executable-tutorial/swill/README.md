## Proposal

I would like to create a tutorial on how to setup the serverless microservice AWS Lambda. The example used in the tutorial will be triggered by AWS SES and then send a response to a specific email.

The main steps of the tutorial will be as follows:
- Setting up SES
- Creating the Lambda function
- Creating an API Gateway
- Configuring the permissions for the Lambda

Microservices such as AWS Lambda are commonly used within DevOps to build a single application as a set of small services.
