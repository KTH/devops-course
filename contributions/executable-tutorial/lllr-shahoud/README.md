## Description

Chaos Mesh is a tool that simulates faults in applications, mimicking real-world scenarios in development, testing and production environments. In this tutorial we're going to deploy a simple application and use Chaos Mesh to simulate network failures and fault scenarios. We will also guide the user through the inspection of the experiments' results using the command line.

**Relevance**

Chaos engineering is very important to identify potential failure points and correct them before they cause an actual outage or other disruption in our deployments.
