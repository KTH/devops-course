## Description

Chaos Mesh is a tool that simulates faults in applications, mimicking real-world scenarios in development, testing and production environments. In this tutorial we're going to deploy an application and use Chaos Mesh to simulate failures and monitor the application's response to these.

**Relevance**

Chaos engineering is very important to identify potential failure points and correct them before they cause an actual outage or other disruption in our deployments.
