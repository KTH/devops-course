## Description

This tutorial will introduce the fundamental concepts of Docker and demonstrate how to build, run, and optimize Docker containers. The tutorial will be fully executable on the KillerKoda platform, ensuring that users can interact with and verify their actions as they follow along. The sections will cover building and running a basic Docker container, setting up Docker volumes for persistent storage, configuring container networking, automating Docker builds with local scripts, and optimizing Docker images with multi-stage builds for improved performance and reduced image size.

**Relevance**
Docker is a crucial tool in modern DevOps practices, enabling efficient application deployment, scalability, and automation. By learning how to build, run, and optimize containers, developers and DevOps engineers can reduce infrastructure complexity, speed up deployments, and manage applications more effectively. The addition of automating Docker builds locally with a script simulates a CI/CD pipeline without needing external dependencies, making it easier to verify the process in a local environment. Multi-stage builds are essential for reducing Docker image size and improving performance in production environments, aligning with DevOps goals of continuous delivery and optimized resource use.
