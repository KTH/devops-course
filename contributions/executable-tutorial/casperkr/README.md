## Description

This tutorial will introduce the basic concepts of serverless computing and demonstrate how to set up and deploy serverless functions using Python. We will cover essential tasks such as configuring the environment, creating basic serverless functions, managing IAM permissions for security, and deploying containers in a serverless architecture. Additionally, we will demonstrate how to integrate serverless deployments into a CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions.

**Relevance**

As serverless computing becomes increasingly popular, understanding how to set up, deploy, and secure serverless applications is essential for modern DevOps practices. By reducing infrastructure management and automating scalability, serverless aligns with core DevOps principles, ensuring faster development cycles and improved collaboration. Furthermore, using IAM permissions guarantees secure operations, while deploying containers enhances flexibility in deploying more complex services.
