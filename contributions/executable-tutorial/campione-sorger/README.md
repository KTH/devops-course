## Description

In this executable tutorial, we will guide the user through running Splunk. We will add a data source and create a dashboard to visualize data using the new Splunk Dashboard Studio. The data source will be set up to dynamically grow in size and change its data over time, showcasing Splunk's real-time capabilities. Finally, we will configure an alert to trigger when a specific data threshold is met.
