## Proposal ##
We will create a [Katacoda](https://www.katacoda.com/) executable tutorial that shows the basics of web frontend testing using the tool [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) and Python.

This is DevOps related since it is a flavor of test automation.

## Execution ##

We have created a tutorial that is available [here](https://www.katacoda.com/m4reko/scenarios/automatic-frontend-testing). The repo is available [here](https://github.com/m4reko/katacoda-scenarios).

## Feedback response ##
We received feedback from August and Christian which can be seen in [this PR](https://github.com/KTH/devops-course/pull/1213).

We modified the following after the feedback:

- Clarified introduction
- Added setup script to get rid of some deprecation errors
- Encouraged the user to test more parts of the driver themselves
- Fixed a few typos
- Clarified why the test pages used are good for testing
- Clarified the importance of copying the code snippets to the correct location
- Added more resources for continued exploration of the subject to the finishing text

The changes can be seen in [this commit](https://github.com/m4reko/katacoda-scenarios/commit/11fc24a214ddf5cee30574217b67fe29f6394907)
