- Rafael Bechara (raeef@kth.se)

## Deadline

- Task 3

## Category

- Executable Tutorial

## Description

We will guide users through managing, checking, and securing npm dependencies. The tutorial will start with using npm audit for basic vulnerability detection. We will then show how to add Snyk for better scanning and analysis. We'll also include a section on how to integrate this with GitHub Actions, showing how to create the necessary YAML files.

We want to create this executable tutorial with Killercoda.

**Relevance**

This is relevant for DevOps because keeping dependencies secure makes the software safer and more reliable, which can help prevent issues from reaching production.

The executable tutorial can be found at [Killercoda](https://killercoda.com/maxisr-raeef/course/executable-tutorial/npm-security) and at [Github](https://github.com/raeef96/Devops_tutorial)
