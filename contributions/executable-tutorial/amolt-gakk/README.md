## Description

In our tutorial we are going to show how to make a Slack bot using the slackclient Python library. This bot will send alerts about the status of a website server such as when the server starts and shuts down, when it reaches a certain number of connections etc.

**Relevance**

The monitoring phase of the DevOps cycle can be very important, especially when working with a high-traffic website or with limited server resources. Having a bot deliver real-time alters about the status of the website can be very valuable to this step of the process. Slack alerts are much more visible than email alerts or going on a monitoring dashboard, thus this makes monitoring more accessible.
