## Description

Piku is a PaaS (Platform as a Service) that allows you to deploy applications to your own servers with a simple `git push`.
It is inspired in Dokku, an open source PaaS alternative to Heroku.
Piku shines in being a lightweight tool, that tries to simplify the deployment of services.
It supports deployment in ARM and x86 architectures and can be ran in low end devices.

The tutorial will consist in the deployment of a simple web application using Piku.
Then, we will test its capability of changing some parameters through environment variables.
Finally, we will extend its functionality through the use of plugins.

The tutorial is hosted at [KillerCoda](https://killercoda.com/pesteves2002/scenario/tutorial),
and its source code can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/speedrunners-ist/devops-tutorial).

**Relevance**

This tutorial allows the user to explore alternatives to known tools/services such as Heroku.
It maintains the most relevant features, while being free and open source.
