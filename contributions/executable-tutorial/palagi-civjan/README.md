Executable Tutorial

## Description

Fuzz testing is an essential topic for testing and security. 

We created a Katacoda Scenario with the goal of teaching the user how to effectively use Atheris, Google's Python Fuzzing tool which is a part of OSS-Fuzz and can be integrated into ones own git repository using ClusterFuzzLite.

In the tutorial we covered: Background information on fuzzing as a testing technique, the Pros and Cons of Fuzzing versus standard or other testing methods, how to integrate Google's Atheris Python fuzzer with a Python program, and how to add this type of fuzzing into a CI workflow with GitHub Actions using ClusterFuzzLite.
