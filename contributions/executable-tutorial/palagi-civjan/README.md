## Description

Fuzz testing is an essential topic for testing and security. 

We will create a browser based jupyter-notebook with the goal of teaching the user how to effectively use OSS-Fuzz to debug a Go project.

In our tutorial we will include descriptions of what **fuzzing** is as a debugging technique as well as show how OSS-Fuzz can be used in practice to create a CI-based fuzz testing development cycle.
