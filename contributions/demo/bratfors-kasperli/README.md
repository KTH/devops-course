## Topic

Demo of using Calico policies in Kubernetes, utilizing the Google Kubernetes Engine.

## Details
Calico is used for network security and source networking for containers and virtual machines. We want to demonstrate how Calico policies can be used in Kubernetes. We will do this using the Google Kubernetes Engine provided on the Google Cloud Platform, we feel that this approach is the most relevant with the increased popularity of Cloud technology.

The demo will (hopefully) include a visual representation of the traffic flow and how the nodes interact depending on their policies.

We plan to screencast the demo and add some voice-over/subtitles.
