## Submission

**The video is available [here](https://youtu.be/mGFS2zUL8mo).**

Description: Our video demo demonstrates how to create a CI/CD pipeline in GitLab for deploying a HTML-file to Amazon S3. Furthermore, we have chosen to include the creation of a custom GitLab Runner in our demo, which we believe distinguishes this video from other videos on the same topic.

Prerequisites: 
* GitLab account (https://about.gitlab.com)
* AWS account (https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
