## Description
This demo focuses on the deployment part of CI/CD. Specifically, automatic deployment. To demonstrate this, a proof of concept web app that can perform division was created and used with our CI/CD pipeline. This application was deployed in a Kubernetes cluster running on Google Kubernetes Engine.

## Criteria we want to fulfill

Here is a list of the criteria we want to fulfill:

* The demonstration screencast is clearly motivated (why it matters for Devops?) -> the demo is clearly motivated at minute 0:30.
* The demonstration screencast is sublime (eg visually appealing) -> There is not to much text and background has been added to differentiate the text from the video. Apart from that, white-colored boxes are used to help the viewer find the parts that are being discussed in the text (e.g. min 1:16).
* The demonstration screencast contains an easter egg -> the demo contains an easter egg that appears at minute 2:56
* An accompanying Github repository has been made (optional) -> A link to the GitHub repository can be found in the video description box.
