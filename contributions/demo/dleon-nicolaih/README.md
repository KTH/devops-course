## Description
This demo focuses on the deployment part of CI/CD. Specifically, automatic deployment. To demonstrate this, a proof of concept web app that can perform division was created and used with our CI/CD pipeline. This application was deployed in a Kubernetes cluster running on Google Kubernetes Engine.

## Criteria we want to fulfill
Here is a list of the criteria we want to fulfill:

* The demonstration screencast is clearly motivated (why it matters for Devops?) 
  - **Motivation**: the demo is clearly motivated at minute 0:30.
 
* The demonstration screencast is sublime (eg visually appealing) 
  - **Motivation**: There is not to much text and background has been added to differentiate the text from the video. Apart from that, white-colored boxes are used to help the viewer find the parts that are being discussed in the text (e.g. min 1:16).

* The demonstration screencast contains an easter egg
  - **Motivation**: the demo contains an easter egg that appears at minute 2:56

* An accompanying Github repository has been made (optional) 
  - **Motivation**: A link to the GitHub repository can be found in the video description box.
  
* The screencast is 3-5 minutes
  - **Motivation**: The demo is 03:01 minutes long.

* The screencast contains subtitles which are clear and in proper English
  - **Motivation**: The above is true for our screencast.
  
* The screencast contains a good and concise take-home message at the end
  - **Motivation**: The take-home messages are clear, concise, and connected to the demo topic.

## Improvements based on feedback
We have now updated our demo with feedback in mind.

- We chose and announced automatic deployment as our focus early in the demo. The time spent on ‘description’ has also been reduced.

- Early parts are now shorter and ‘time for demo’ now starts earlier.

- The very long sequences with no explanation are now either accelerated or have an explanation.

- The take-home messages are now connected to the demo topic.

- The learning objective is now clearly explained in minute 0:17.
