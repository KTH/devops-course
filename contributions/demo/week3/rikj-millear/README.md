## Description

In this demo, we will walk you through configuring GitLab CI/CD for the automated deployment of a full-stack web application on a self-hosted server using Docker. We will cover the prerequisites, CI/CD variables, setting up a Docker image, installing necessary packages, SSH access to the server, and pulling the latest Docker container to recreate the application.

**Relevance**

This demo is relevant because it demonstrates how to streamline the deployment process using GitLab CI/CD, on a self hosted server. Automating the deployment of a full-stack web application reduces manual effort. By integrating Docker, it enhances portability and scalability, allowing developers to deploy applications seamlessly to self-hosted servers or other environments.
