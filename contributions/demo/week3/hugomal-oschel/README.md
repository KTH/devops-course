## Description

We will demonstrate how to automate the software release process using jReleaser and GitHub Actions. The GitHub Actions workflow will be triggered when a new release tag is pushed to the repository. jReleaser will handle tasks such as generating a changelog from commit messages, packaging the software, signing artifacts.


**Relevance**

jReleaser is an emerging tool for automating software releases, making it a valuable addition to any DevOps pipeline. This demo will show how jReleaser can simplify the release process by automating tedious tasks like changelog generation, artifact signing, and multi-platform distribution. Using GitHub Actions for automation further showcases how continuous integration and delivery can be extended to cover the entire lifecycle of a software project, from code changes to final release.
