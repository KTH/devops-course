## Description
This demo will cover the importance of having a deployment strategy and show how 
blue green deployment can be achieved on the web hosting platform Vercel (https://vercel.com/).
The demo will entail showing some basic website (Blue environment) and making a small change 
to the site (Green environment) during the demo. The new deployment/website will be configured on stage to direct some of 
the traffic to the domain to go to the Blue environment and some to the Green environment with no downtime.

**Relevance**
Blue-Green Deployment is relevant to DevOps because it provides a strategy for seamless
releases with minimal downtime. This is a core objective of DevOps practices. When having
two separate environments, a "Blue" one for the current version and a "Green" one for the
new version, it allows teams to deploy new code with safety. Developers can also test the
code in production and switch traffic between environments with minimal risk. This strategy
reduces the impact of failures and enables quick rollbacks. It also promotes continuous 
delivery and deployment, which improves factors such as speed and reliability of software releases.
