## Description

We want to demonstrate a way to deploy Azure resource from a dev-environment to a prod-environment using Azure Devops Pipelines. This demonstration will show how the deployment is triggered and how the pipeline determines whether or not to deploy to prod- We will also show the effects of the deployment to prod.

The demo will show how a VM in prod environment will get READ access to an keyvault, so it can read its secrets.

**Relevance**

This demo is relevant to DevOps as it shows how deployoment to different environments can be automated using popular cloud services, such as Azure.
