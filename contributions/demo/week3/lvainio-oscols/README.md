## Description

Story: Manager wants to go from Continuous Delivery to Continuous Deployment using the same platform (GoCD). 

We will demonstrate how we can change the configuration in GoCD to go from Continuous Delivery to Continuous Deployment. We will use a small example project for this demo and we will use Gomatic to allow us to configure the GoCD pipeline in code.  


**Relevance**

GoCD is a CI/CD tool which is useful to know how to use. Also, itâ€™s important to understand the difference between Continuous Delivery and Continuous Deployment and in this demo our goal is to illustrate the main differences. In Continuous Delivery, changes that pass automated tests still need manual approval but in Continuous Deployment even the deployment step is automated.
