## Description

This demo is intended to walk the audience through the deployment of a web application setup on AWS using Terraform and Github Actions CI/CD pipelines. The demo will start with the setup of Terraform for AWS, with a detailed explanation of the how the HashiCorp Configuration Language works. We will show the case where CD pipeline fails, followed by troubleshooting and fixing the issue to complete the deployment. Finally, we will reflect on how useful Terraform is, and the limits it may have.

**Relevance**

Computer Science students often avoid deployment because it typically involves paid services or complicated interfaces. In this demo, we aim to show how a developer new to DevOps can get started with Continuous Deployment using simple Terraform code, a widely-used Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool. IaCs are crucial in modern development because they allow for automated, consistent, and scalable infrastructure management. The deployment will be done on AWS, the most widely used cloud provider, which offers a free plan, and will be continuously deployed using GitHub Actions, an accessible tool. This combination of tools provides an easy, quick, and intuitive starting point.
