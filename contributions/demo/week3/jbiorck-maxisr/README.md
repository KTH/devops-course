## Description
We want to demonstrate how to automate versioning and changelog generation into an automated CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) using release-please, ensuring that new updates are correctly tracked and reflected in production deployments. To display changes clearly, we want to create a simple website which we will make small changes on during the demo. During the demonstration we plan to show a commit with a conventional commit message that release-please accepts and we also plan to show what happens when you write a commit message which is not accepted.


**Relevance**


An important part of DevOps and CD is automation, and this automates part of the CI/CD pipeline.
