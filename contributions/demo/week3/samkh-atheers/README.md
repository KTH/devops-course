- Week 3

## Category

## Description

Our demo will show how one can deploy their github project using Railway, we will show how to set up the connection with Railway so that the project becomes deployed. 
Then we will show how the application redeploys when the code changes (continuous deployment). 
Finally we will show one can perform a rollback to previous deployment using Railway. 
Along the way we will also showcase relevant features that Railway provides that are tied with the demo like showing build logs, and deployment logs,
where one can set environment variables, and monitor resource usage (here, we will only show the CPU and memory usage of the deployment). 

**Relevance**

The proposal is relevant to DevOps as it shows how Railway can be used as tool to perform Continuous Deployment (CD) which is a big part of DevOps. 
Also we are showing rollbacks which is also an important feature to have when using Continous Deployment, and finally we are introducing Railway to everyone in the 
class (Railway has never been showcased before) which can be used to deploy various other things like databases and docker images.
