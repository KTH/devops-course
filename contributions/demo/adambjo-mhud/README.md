## Topic

Demo of virtual network peering in Microsoft Azure.

## Details
According to Microsoft, Virtual network peering enables a seamless connection between Azure virtual networks. By using both private and global virtual network peering, it is possible to route traffic with low-latency, high-bandwidth. Virtual machines can communicate with other virtual machines by using VNP. This communication process is connected with other resources such as Azure subscription, Azure Active Directory(AAD) in the Azure portal. As this communication is private, there is no necessity to implement encryption. In this demo, we will present how to create multiple virtual machines,  virtual network peering in the Azure portal.
