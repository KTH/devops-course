## Names and KTH ID

## Deadline

- Week 7

## Category

- Demo

## Description

Bandit is a SAST tool designed to analyze Python code for potential security vulnerabilities using a set of predefined rules, such as identifying the use of hardcoded credentials, deserialization of untrusted data, or SQL injection vulnerabilities. I plan to use some cases to illustrate and fix the problems detected by Bandit.

**Relevance**

DevOps teams need to implement security testing as early as possible in the development process to identify potential vulnerabilities before they are deployed into production. This is where Bandit comes in.
