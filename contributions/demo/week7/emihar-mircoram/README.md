## Description

We will hold a demo talking and showing how Maven’s BOM can be used on top of existing POM dependencies to create a more structured dependency management. The demo will showcase how BOM works as well as highlight different implementations, for example using it as a parent POM or as an imported dependency.

**Relevance**

This demo is relevant as BOM is an easy and clear way to make dependency management easier while still allowing for developers to overwrite it.
