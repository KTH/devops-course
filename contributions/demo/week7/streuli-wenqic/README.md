## Description

In this demo, we will explore the importance of Data Version Control (DVC) in the context of Machine Learning operations (MLOps). We'll start by discussing the challenges associated with managing and versioning large datasets and ML models, especially when these assets need to evolve alongside the codebase to maintain project coherence and reproducibility. We'll introduce DVC, a powerful tool designed to handle data and model versioning seamlessly alongside code changes. We will demonstrate how to integrate DVC into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, ensuring that changes in data and models are as traceable and manageable as changes in the application code.

**Relevance**

Data versioning is indispensable in the sphere of MLOps as it guarantees that changes to datasets and models are consistently applied across all stages of the development lifecycle. This approach not only enhances collaboration among data scientists and engineers but also significantly mitigates risks associated with data and model drift.
