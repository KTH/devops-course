## Description
We aim to demonstrate how pnpm downloads modules into a single content-addressable storage and gives hard-links to different projects to save disk space, and how pnpm is faster than the alternative (in the paper benchmarks are `npm`, `Yarn`, and `Yarn PnP`).

We will create several Node.js projects that use the same modules and show that after running `pnpm install` the hard links are created in `node_modules` folder which points to the same folder on the disk. Also at the same time we will run `npm install`, measure the performance and give explanations.

** Relevance **
Node.js is one of the most popular Javascript runtime environments for web application development, and pnpm provides better performance on managing Node packages than the Node.js default package manager `npm`.
