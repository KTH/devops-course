## Description
In this demo we will first give a quick overview of the Nix package manager. In particular, we will explain why it is reproducible, declarative and reliable, and how it differs from typical package managers.

Then, we will showcase the quirks and features of NixOS, the operating system built on Nix.
Most importantly, we will show why somebody would want to use NixOS. 

**Relevance** 
As an operating system with reproducible and declarative configuration at its base, NixOS is highly relevant for DevOps. Its prevalent use case lies in creating test and production environments. The safe and atomic upgrades and roll-backs of Nix further strengthen this position.
