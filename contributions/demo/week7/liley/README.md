## Names and KTH ID

  - Jonas Liley (liley@kth.se)

## Deadline

- Week 7

## Category

- Demo

## Description

The demonstration will involve setting up a Wazuh server alongside an additional server that will simulate a production environment. I will walk through the process of adding a new server to be monitored by Wazuh, enabling Wazuh to collect and analyze logs, detect vulnerabilities, and monitor system integrity. The demo will also include real-time detection of suspicious activities and automated alerting on potential security incidents.

**Relevance**

With the increasing complexity of modern infrastructure, gaining deep security observability across all systems is essential for proactive threat detection and mitigation. Wazuh, as an open-source security monitoring platform, addresses these needs. This demo highlights Wazuhâ€™s capability to centralize security data, helping organizations detect vulnerabilities, track incidents, and ensure compliance, all within a one dashboard.
