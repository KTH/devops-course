## Motivation
Testing is important aspect in software development. In DevOps, it is important with continious integration and deployment. This ongoing, neverstoping process requires easy access to valuable information such as the percentage of covered code, and what part of the code that lacks tests. This is important in order to verify that the code does what it is supposed to do. By adding a badge displaying the percentage of covered code to the first page of the repo, it is easy for everyone to get access to that valuable information and act on it. Generating a more extensive report via Clover can show where tests are needed in a more detailed way. Clover reports can show parts of functions that needs tests, and what parts of the projects that are in most need of tests, and much more. The combination of the badge and the report is a good base for a project.

## Description
The demo shows 
- how to setup Maven and Travis for a basic Java project,
- how to set up a badge on the repo's first page with the help of CodeCov,
- how to generate a Clover report for the repo.
