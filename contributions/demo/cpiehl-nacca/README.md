### Proposal:

We want to make a demo where we deploy a machine learning model on an AWS EKS cluster and explore some of the functionality offered by Kubeflow. We are not exactly sure how much we will be able to fit into the 3 minute demo but these things might be interesting to include:

- Model serving and online prediction
- Kubeflow pipelines to automate training and validation
- Model monitoring
