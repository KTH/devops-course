### Changes following feedback:

- Subtitles are added using automatic captioning, and the errors have been manually fixed.
- Music volume has been lowered.
- Some extra explanations have been added to the script.
- A take-home message has been added.
- Chapters have been added to the progress bar. In the video description the chapters have links to the corresponding part of the repo. This was made to deal with certain parts being hard to read/follow due to clutter.
