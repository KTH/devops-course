## Actions Done Based on Feedback
- [x] Remove a few sentences (we tried to remove a few parts, but it felt like the instructions got unclear) to slow down the pace a bit.
- [x] Zoom in the when viewing the editor and the terminal to make the scripts and commands more readable.
- [x] 00:30, the whole script were not visible, add the entire script on the frame
- [x] 1:15, update the easter egg.
- [x] 1:40, change the pronunciation of 'CLI'
- [x] 2:03 fix typo in the subtitles, from 'coped' to 'copied'.
