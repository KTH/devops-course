## Topic
Demo of deploying a CI/CD pipeline with gitlabs using docker, kubernetes and azure.

We want to create a website for weather where we can use easily update, add and change information with the help of CD. We chose Azure as its one of the more popular programs when doing CD pipelines.


We also want to use azure to have 100% uptime. And it is easily compatible with kubernetes.


We will focus our demo more on using azure to build on different OS, atleast linux/windows/mac and make sure our program works on all of them.
