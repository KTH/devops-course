## Topic
Demo of how to implement a CI/CD pipeline with Travis and Google App Engine on a React aplication. 

## Details
Continuous integration and continuous delivery are relevant parts of DevOps, and we would like to learn more about how to implement it. We will create a React application that is connected to GitHub, and demonstrate how Travis CI can deploy and run end-to-end tests with Google App Engine, triggered by a git push command. 

## Structure
- The agenda of the presentation 
- Demo on how to implement it

## Grading criterias that we aim to fulfill are: 

|                                             | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|-------------------------------------------- | ----|----|-------------|
|The demonstration screencast is clearly motivated (why it matters for Devops?) | **Yes** | No | **Remarkable** |
|The demonstration screencast is difficult to do | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|The demonstration screencast is original | **Yes** | No | Remarkable |
|The demonstration screencast is sublime (eg visually appealing) | **Yes** | No | **Remarkable** |
|The demonstration screencast contains an easter egg | **Yes** | No | **Remarkable** |
|An accompanying Github repository has been made (optional) | **Yes** | No | Remarkable |

Motivation for the criterias: 

**The demonstration screencast is clearly motivated:** Yes, Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment are essential parts in DevOps. We clearly state why it is important and relevant in the demo in the take-home message. 

**The demonstration screencast is original:** Yes, we have seen variants of this demo but nothing that is completely similar to this. Also, the idea with the easter-egg is something we think is original.

**The demonstration screencast is sublime:** Yes, the demo is visually appealing. For example, we highlight different buttons when they are being pressed so that the user easier can follow the demo. Also, the screen is zoomed in and with subtitles describing the different steps, so that you can follow what is happening on the screen very well. We also provide a voice-over describing the steps in order to be extra clear.  

**The demonstration screencast contains an easter egg:** Yes, we provide an easter-egg that is hidden in our application. The user must type the word "devops" in order to see the easter-egg, which is a bonus section where we describe how to also integrate code-coverage to the pipeline.  

**An accompanying Github repository has been made (optional):** Yes, the link is provided here in the README and also in the Youtube-video.
