## Topic
Demo of how to implement a CI/CD pipeline with Travis and Google App Engine on a React aplication. 

## Details
Continuous integration and continuous delivery are relevant parts of DevOps, and we would like to learn more about how to implement it. We will create a React application that runs on Google App Engine, and demonstrate how Travis CI can deploy and run end-to-end tests that are triggered by a git push command, as a part of the testing process. 

## Structure
- Introduction to Continuous Delivery and Travis CI 
- Demo on how to implement it 
- Main take-aways
