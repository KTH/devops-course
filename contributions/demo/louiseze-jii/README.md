[Screencast](https://youtu.be/u39NtaHsziM)


## Details
We want to make a video demo on the mutation testing system PIT. We will demonstrate how you install PIT in the IDE IntelliJ and let PIT run the unit tests in a Java project. We will also upload the Java project to Github, so that people can use that one for testing to install and use PIT.


## Demo structure
- Short introduction to Pitest
- Demo on how to implement it
- Show how to use it on code

## Criteria

We aim to pass following criteria:
- The demonstration screencast is clearly motivated

  Yes, we clearly state the importance of mutation testing.

- The demonstration screencast is original

  Yes, since the demo is connected to the repository which the user can clone.

- The demonstration screencast is sublime

  Yes, we think it's visually appealing.

- The demonstration screencast contains an easter egg

  Yes. If you check the output of the tests that we run in the beginning, you will se that one of them gives the output 0x6465766f7073, which is devops in hexadecimal. We also give a hint to the easter egg later in the video, by having a tab in the browser that says "Best Hex To String Converter".

- An accompanying GitHub repository has been made

  Yes.
