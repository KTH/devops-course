## Topic
Demo of mutation testing with [Pitest](https://pitest.org/) and the IDE IntelliJ.


## Details
We want to make a video demo on the mutation testing system PIT. We will demonstrate how you install PIT, integrate it to the IDE IntelliJ and let PIT run the unit tests in a Java project. We will also upload the Java project to Github, so that people can use that one for testing their own installation and integration of PIT.

## Demo structure
- Short introduction to Pitest
- Demo on how to implement it
- Show how to use it on code
