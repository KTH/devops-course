## Feedback   
From the feedback received from other students, I've done the following changes:
- Added more information to the repository containing the demo,
- Added a slide in the beginning to improve the flow and clarify DevOps connection,
- Added transitions between certain parts (both between "scenes" but also in the end for each takeaway),
- Added more zoom at parts that were difficult to follow/had much whitespace,
- Increased the video quality, 
- Lowered the music a tiny bit to make it less distracting.
