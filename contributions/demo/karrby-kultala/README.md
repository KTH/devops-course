## Proposal/motivation

Original proposal PR is #1076 

## Submission

The video demo can be found at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SKJYKNKyaqI

## What we did

- Created a Chrome extension that spawns easter eggs on websites, and lets the user collect these eggs ([available here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/easter-eggstension/lkeplkoegchdobbdodnocghcikijbnfm?hl=en)).
- Created a video demo showcasing an automated CI/CD pipeline for developing extensions for Google Chrome.
  - Work is done in feature branches, and tests are automatically run on commits.
  - Feature branches are merged into the dev-branch, representing an "unofficial" version of the extension, available to trusted testers. Tests are run on PRs to this branch.
  - For official releases (that appear for everyone), the dev-branch is merged into the main-branch.
- Subtitles are available (have to be manually activated by the viewer)
- Sources for all images are disclosed throughout the video, and in the video description.
