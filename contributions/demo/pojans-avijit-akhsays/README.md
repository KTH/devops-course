## Topic
We want to make a demo of the self-healing feature within Kubernetes. We are designing and implementing a web service which the viewers can interact with make requests to; and some of these requests will tank the web service, which triggers the self-healing. 

We have some original ideas on how to trigger the self-healing and are currently researching how to make this demo look the best and be of educational value.

## Tech
Currently, we're looking into using Google Kubernetes Engine within the Google Cloud. Web service will be coded in Node.js.
