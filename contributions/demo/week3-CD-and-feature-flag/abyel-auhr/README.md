## Description

This demo aims to demonstrate the usefulness of Bitbucket Pipes, a CI/CD tool in which the developer builds custom pipelines in a _plug-and-play_ fashion. 
We start our demo with a basic application and a demonstration of continuous delivery and deployment through a push to the Bitbucket repo, which triggers the pipeline. 
The pipeline will build and deploy the application to Herouku.
