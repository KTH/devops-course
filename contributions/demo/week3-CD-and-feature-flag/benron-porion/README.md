## Description
Feature flags participate in facilitating feature release, reducing the time needed to deploy a new feature. Plus, they allow one to test the new feature through staged release either to control that the feature performs as expected or to analyse user responses to new features, both using a restricted set of users. The demonstration aims to present the feature flag and remote configuration service [Flagsmith](https://flagsmith.com/) that ease feature flags management and features release.
