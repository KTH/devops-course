## Description

DigitalOcean Kubernetes (DOKS) is a managed Kubernetes service that lets you deploy Kubernetes clusters without the complexities of handling the control plane and containerized infrastructure. In this demo we will show a CI/CD
pipeline with Github Actions for different microservices of a simple application where on each push to the master branch will trigger an action that will update the docker image for the microservice and deploy it on the digital ocean cluster.
