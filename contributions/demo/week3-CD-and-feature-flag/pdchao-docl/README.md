DEMO

## Description

A lot of python libraries are uploaded and downloaded through PIP, making a continuous deployment pipeline crucial to fast deployment. The continuous pipeline would automate the process of version control making it easier to upload new code to PIP. 

We plan to make a live demo that starts with an uploaded web api and add a github action that automatically deploys to PIP, if all the test suite passes. We will show both the github action passing and failing to demonstrate both sides of the pipeline.
