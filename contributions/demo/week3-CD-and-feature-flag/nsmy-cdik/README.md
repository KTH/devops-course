## Description

In this Demo we are going to be creating a CI/CD pipeline for a simple
application in Nodejs. The deployment platform will initially be Heroku but we plan on letting the user
pick one of the available deployment platforms between Google App Engine/Heroku/Kubernetes. The pipeline
will also be implemented to notify the development team with Slack when the build fails.
