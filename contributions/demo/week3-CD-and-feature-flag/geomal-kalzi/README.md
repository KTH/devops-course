## Description

In its most basic form Feature flag is a technique that is used to toggle some functionality in the code on and off. This is done without the need to deploy new code. The ability to toggle some feature on and off on the fly is exploited by developers to test whether a new feature behaves as it should or to analyze the response to the feature by only exposing it to a set of users. In this demonstration we aim to demonstrate feature flagging using on of the most popular feature management softwares [Unleash](https://www.getunleash.io/).
