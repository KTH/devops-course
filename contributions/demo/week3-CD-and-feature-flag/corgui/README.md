## Description

Tauri is a rust based GUI framework which allows creating smaller, faster and more secure desktop applications with a
web frontend. Tauri allows developers to easily add an automatic updater in their app. The aim of this demo is to show
how a Continuous Delivery pipeline can be used to automatically build and release new versions of a Tauri app, which can
then be used by the Tauri updater.
