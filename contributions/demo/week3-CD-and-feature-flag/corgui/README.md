## Description

Tauri is a rust based GUI framework which allows creating smaller, faster and more secure desktop applications with a
web frontend. Tauri allows developers to easily add an automatic updater in their app.

In this demo I showed how a developper can implement a pipeline to deploy automaticaly a new version of its Tauri
application. The work consist on the creation of a CircleCI pipeline, a server to hold and serve updates metadata and
the actual application used for the demonstration.

During the demo, I showed a realtime deployement of a new version of the app, and I explained how it is related to CD.

This demo also includes an easter egg, to find it you should probably take a closer look at the dialog window asking for
whether a new update should be installed.
