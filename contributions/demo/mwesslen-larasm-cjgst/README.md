## Proposal ##
We propose a demonstration of how to create a simple React app using Firebase hosting and Cloud Functions to create app logic. The app will be hosted in a serverless manner.

## Related to DevOps ## 
* The server will use cloud functions that are being run in Firebase as opposed to the server itself
* We will automatically deploy the main branch to Firebase

## Plan ##
* Create a working prototype in React with Firebase
* Create cloud function
* Automatically deploy from main branch to Firebase
* Create script for recording
* Record
* Post to GitHub

### Tools ###
- React
- Firebase
  - Cloud Functions
  - Hosting
