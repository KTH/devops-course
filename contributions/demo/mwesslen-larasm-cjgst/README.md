## Proposal ##
We propose a demonstration of how to create a simple React app using Firebase hosting and Cloud Functions to create app logic. The app will be hosted in a serverless manner.

## Related to DevOps ##
* The server will use cloud functions that are being run in Firebase as opposed to the server itself
* We will automatically deploy the main branch to Firebase

## Plan ##
* Create a working prototype in React with Firebase
* Create cloud function
* Automatically deploy from main branch to Firebase
* Create script for recording
* Record
* Post to GitHub

### Tools ###
- React
- Firebase
  - Cloud Functions
  - Hosting

## Execution ##
Our video demo is available [here (old version)](https://youtu.be/DdCsPe-yvXE). We also have a repo containing the sample project which can be found [here](https://github.com/m4reko/laras-app).

## Feedback ##
We received some feedback at the demo day and acted upon it, resulting in a slightly changed video (and description) which can be found [here](https://youtu.be/vOl4YGdWigM)!
