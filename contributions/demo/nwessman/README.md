## Description

This demo aims to show how to use DevOps practice **Chaos engineering** to conduct **Chaos testing** in a deployed environment to test the robustness of the system. This demo will include the set up of a simple system and then go through the steps of setting up and conducting Chaos tests on the system while explaining the benefits of the practice. The tool used for the chaos testing will be **Chaos Toolkit**.
