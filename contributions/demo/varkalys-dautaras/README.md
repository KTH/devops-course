## Topic
Continuous Deployment on Kubernetes cluster using Rancher pipelines

## Motivation
Rancher is a great tool which simplifies management of Kubernetes cluster through the intuitive UI.
It also has pipelines feature, which allows to run CI/CD jobs and see their status on the same UI environment.
Having everything at the same place is a great benefit, so our demo will show the setup of Rancher pipelines as well as explain the main features of Rancher UI.
As an example, we will demonstrate the continues deployment of a simple api to Kubernetes cluster using Rancher pipelines.
