## Proposal

After building software that users depend on every day it becomes clear that uptime and response times are very important measures to always keep track of. We need to be able to respond quickly when something goes wrong, and want to know when an endpoint doesn't work; preferably before the user even notices. There are some paid, closed-source tools that achieve this, but there's very few self-hosted, open-source alternatives.

[Cloudprober](https://cloudprober.org) is a good option; it is an open-source monitoring tool that makes it easy to monitor availability and performance of applications. In this demo we will show how to setup Cloudprober to monitor an API and then display the data in [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io).


## Submission
We've now completed the demo, it consists of a 3:00 minute youtube video that can be found [here]() and an accompanying github repository [here](https://github.com/Atema/Cloudprober-Demo) that includes written instructions as well as all the configuration files used in the demo. With it we aim to fulfill the following criterias:

|                                             | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|-------------------------------------------- | ----|----|-------------|
|The demonstration is clearly motivated (why it matters for Devops?) | ðŸ”¥ Yes | No | Relates to a hard problem |
|The demonstration is difficult to do | ðŸ”¥ Yes | No | Relies on a non trivial infrastructure |
|The demonstration is original | Yes | No | ðŸ”¥ The are less than 10 demos on the topic on Internet |
|The video is sublime (eg visually appealing) | ðŸ”¥ Yes | No | Excellent narrative |
|The video contains an [easter egg](https://github.com/OrkoHunter/python-easter-eggs) | Yes | No | ðŸ”¥ Related to the demo |
|There is a code repo to run the demo  | Yes | No | ðŸ”¥ Code repo with a solid readme |
|The video must contain subtitles which are clear and in proper English | Yes | No | ðŸ”¥ Clearly understandable voice over |
|The video includes a take-home message | Yes | No | ðŸ”¥ Actionable takeaway |
