## CD Pipeline with GitLab Auto Devops deploying to a Kubernetes cluster on GKE
I would like to setup a CD Pipeline that automatically build and test new changes and deploy them automatically after a review is approved.

My goal is to achieve this with the [Auto Devops](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/topics/autodevops/) feature of GitLab and deploy tested and reviewed code to a Kubernetes cluster on the [Google Kubernetes Engine](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/).
