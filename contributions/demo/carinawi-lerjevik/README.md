## Proposal
We would like to create an easy-to-follow video demo that demonstrates how to deploy an application following a CI/CD pipeline using AWS and GitLab.
 
We aim to fulfill the following criteria:
|                                             | Yes | No | Remarkable |
|-------------------------------------------- | ----|----|-------------|
|The demonstration is clearly motivated (why it matters for Devops?) | **Yes** | No | **Relates to a hard problem** |
|The demonstration is difficult to do | **Yes** | No | Relies on a non trivial infrastructure |
|The demonstration is original | Yes | No | The are less than 10 demos on the topic on Internet |
|The video is sublime (eg visually appealing) | **Yes** | No | **Excellent narrative** |
|The video contains an [easter egg](https://github.com/OrkoHunter/python-easter-eggs) | **Yes** | No | **Related to the demo** |
|There is a code repo to run the demo  | **Yes** | No | **Code repo with a solid readme** |
|The video must contain subtitles which are clear and in proper English | **Yes** | No | **Clearly understandable voice over** |
|The video includes a take-home message | **Yes** | No | **Actionable takeaway** |
