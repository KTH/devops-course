## Topic
Deploying an online storage system on Microsoft Azure

## Motivation
------------------------------------NEW------------------------------------------
As storage is essential for any Devlopment we would like to demonstrate how it can be done using infrastructure as code. This allowes use of tool like Github in order to keep config of the infrastructure. Also as we are moving to a serverless world most people don't want to use self hosted servers for storage/IAAS. As such we want to deply azure storage using Terraform, this allows the us to control the infrastucture using vesion control and utalize a cloud service that allows us to scale up and down as need.

------------------------------------ReMoVE------------------------------------------
By different reason, people may want to have a self hosted service. We would like to demonstrate that how easy and secure of using Terraform than self host server. For most of the online service, we should considering about the public docer like Azure as it is easier to increase the bandwidth, speed and storage size by top up.
