## Topic
Deploying an online storage system on Microsoft Azure

## Motivation
As storage is essential for any Devlopment, we would like to demonstrate how it can be done using infrastructure as code. This allowes use of tool like Github in order to keep config of the infrastructure. Also as we are moving to a serverless world most people don't want to use self hosted servers for storage/IAAS. As such we want to deply azure storage using Terraform, this allows the us to control the infrastucture using vesion control and utalize a cloud service that allows us to scale up and down as need.
