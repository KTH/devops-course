## Proposal
Video demo showing how to establish communication between several different (containerised) applications using a message broker such as RabbitMQ.  
The demo shows a good example of how a pipeline-like service can be achieved among multiple programs, without changing any of their underlying funcitonality.  
The pattern used will include a work queue (with a producer and multiple competeing consumers), which has real-life applicability in load balancing.  
Source code will be included.
