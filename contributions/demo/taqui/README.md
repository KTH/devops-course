## Proposal
I want to create a video demo on how to leverage Kubernetes and Docker for a Microservice Infrastucture. My plan currently would be to use GKE and to create aprox 4 containers.

I want to build a small bidding platform that shows how the different services are leveraged. In this platform user will be able to create products and other users will be able to bid on them.

The Services I am currently thinking about:

- 1 Frontend
- 1 Auth Service for Authentication
- 1 Service which has a small Node.js backend
- 1 Service with a C# backend
- 1 Container with a MongoDB instance
