## Proposal

We would like to demo an unreleased application CloudKit that we have worked with a few years ago. This app makes it much easier for Salesforce developers to deploy instances to production by providing the following features:
- Automatic dependency checking
- Automatically finds and displays merge conflicts between instances
- One click deployments

Salesforce is a CRM system that is used by many companies. However it is notorious for being bad at showing which dependencies are missing between instances and in general it can be hard to find which parts create conflicts. We believe this relates to DevOps since it automates certain parts of the process making it much easier to deploy from eg. Dev to Production.
