# Demo proposal: CD of Node Express App on Google Cloud with designated realese branch using github actions

In this demo, we will demonstrate how to create a continuous deployment workflow using GitHub Actions that automate deployment of a simple Express server to Google App Engine (GAE), a fully managed, serverless platform for developing and hosting web applications at scale. We will go through the following:
1. How to create a simple Express server
2. How to create a project on Google Cloud
3. How to deploy the Express server to Google App Engine (GAE)
4. How to create a CD workflow to automate deployment using GitHub Actions

## Motivation

The motivation for why this demo matters to DevOps is twofold.
- It shows how to deploy an application on Google Cloud which increases productivity and flexibility, frees up developers by taking away the demands of managing infrastructure and provides automatic scaling.
- It demonstrates how to create a continuous deployment workflow using GitHub actions, which is one of the cornerstones of DevOps.

## Take home message
Make sure to **NOT** commit your `gcloud_secret.json` file to GitHub. This could give malicious actors remote access to your Google Cloud account.
