## Proposal
Demoing the process of setting up a monitoring service for Docker using
Prometheus and Grafana. Prometheus is used as a back-end to gather 
statistics and logs. Grafana is used to visualize the statistics in a 
nice way. Both tools are open-source.

We will have some Docker containers running on a local machine and 
after the monitoring service has been set up we will show statistics
such as network usage, memory usage and CPU usage for the different 
containers.
