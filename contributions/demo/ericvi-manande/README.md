## Proposal
Demoing the process of setting up a monitoring service for Docker using
Datadog.

We will have some Docker containers running on a local machine and 
after the monitoring service has been set up we will show statistics
such as network usage, memory usage and CPU usage for the different 
containers.

## Submission
In this demo we show how to integrate Datadog with Docker in order to monitor 
your containers. Examples of metrics are CPU usage and network usage.

## Criteria
These are the criteria we believe that we have achieved.

| Criteria  | Yes  | No  | Remarkable  |
|---|---|---|---|
| The demonstration is clearly motivated (why it matters for Devops?)  | Yes. Explained in the video  |   |   |
| The video is sublime (eg visually appealing)  | Yes. Nice editing.  |   | Yes  |
| The video contains an easter egg  | Yes (dog gifs)  |   | Datadog = dog gifs  |
| The video must contain subtitles which are clear and in proper English  | Yes  |   | Yes, clear voiceover |
| The video includes a take-home message  | Yes. At the end of the video  |   |   |

## Changes made on the feedback based on demo day
  - Remove scene with account registration (felt unnecessary)
  - Extended scene where the dashboard is shown and added additional voiceover
  - Renamed video title from "Datadog in 3 minutes" to "Integrate Datadog with Docker"
  - Audio adjustments: increase voice volume and lower music volume
