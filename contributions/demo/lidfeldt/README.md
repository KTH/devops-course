## Description
DevOps with no measurement is a fail!

Measuring your DevOps successes and failures allows an organization to correctly prioritize. Jenkins - the most commonly used automation server - allows flexible CI/CD with thousands of plugins. In my video demo I will demonstrate how one can combine Jenkins with Prometheus and Grafana to start monitoring your strengths and weaknesses in how your organization is performing in terms of DevOps.


In this demo, I will:
- Explain the purpose of monitoring your DevOps progression
- Show how to install Prometheus plugin for Jenkins
- Show how to install Prometheus and configure it to pull data from Jenkins
- Show how to install Grafana and configure it to show data from Prometheus
- Show how to make your first dashboard using Grafana

Tools I will use:
- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/)
  - [Prometheus plugin for Jenkins](https://plugins.jenkins.io/prometheus/)
- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/)
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
