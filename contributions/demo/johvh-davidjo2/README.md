## Topic

Demo of a CI/CD pipeline using Github actions.

## Details

We have implemented a CI/CD pipeline for a small website using Docker and Github actions. The demo shows how the pipeline works in action. 

We also provide the viewers with a take-home message. The repository is also available on Github so that the viewer can fork it if they want to experiment with the pipeline.
