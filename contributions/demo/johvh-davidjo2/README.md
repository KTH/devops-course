## Topic

Demo of a CI/CD pipeline using Github actions.

## Details

We will implement a CI/CD pipeline for a small application using Docker. The application will be a minimal python webserver hosted on DigitalOcean. The pipeline will use Github actions to set up an environment, build the app, test it and, if successfull, deploy it. 

The demo itself will show the pipeline in action as a change is pushed to the production branch. This includes showing the website before and after the change, ensuring that everything worked correctly.

The motivation behind the demo is to learn more about containerization and explore Github actions which has been released relatively recently.
