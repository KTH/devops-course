## Topic

Demo of a CI/CD pipeline using Github actions.

## Details

We have implemented a CI/CD pipeline for a small website using Docker and Github actions. The demo shortly presents how Github action works and also shows how the pipeline we set up functions. 

We also provide the viewers with a take-home message. The repository is also available on Github so that the viewer can fork it if they want to experiment with the pipeline.
