## Topic

Demo of a CI/CD pipeline using Github actions.

## Details

We have implemented a CI/CD pipeline for a small website using Docker and Github actions. The demonstrations describes and shows how the pipeline works in action. 

The demo shows how the CI/CD pipeline handles the two following scenarions: 
- When a pull request is made to the master branch.
- When a push is made to master.

Lastly, we provide the viewers with a take-home message. The repository is also available on Github so that the viewer can fork it if they want to experiment with the pipeline.
