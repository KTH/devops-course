## Description

With the NodeJS ecosystem, JavaScript can be used in both frontend and backend. As with any software stack, unit and integration testing are an essential part, yet selecting the right tool for each individual use case can be a challenge, as NodeJS-based environments can be highly diverse.

In this demonstration, we show how JavaScript-/NodeJS-based frontends and backends can be tested in real life and how to set up and run such tests with the respective frameworks. Specifically, we will demonstrate the combined use of Jest and Supertest for the backend and its HTTP routes and React Testing Library for the frontend.
