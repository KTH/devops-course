## Description

Software bots is a very fascinating topic. Did you know that there were bots for Machine Learning as well? In this demo, we are going to show how one could create a telegram bot, in order to monitor the training of Machine Learning models remotely (with a possibility to control the training remotely as well). We think this is a very useful feature for Machine Learning Engineers when developing and deploying their models that makes use of Software bots.
