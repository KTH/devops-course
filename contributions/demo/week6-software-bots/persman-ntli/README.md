## Description

We want to write and demo a custom Slack bot that interacts with the Github API, allowing to trigger specific actions by simply writing the pipeline to run in the chat. It also provides information on whether certain Github Actions were successful. Since we are planning to write our own custom bot, we can customize it for specific use cases.

We plan to either showcase usage of the Slack bot or create a demo on how to create one for this specific usecase depending on how advanced the bot turns out to be.
