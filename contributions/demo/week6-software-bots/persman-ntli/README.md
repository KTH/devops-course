## Description

We want to write and demo a custom Discord bot that interacts with the Github API, allowing to trigger specific actions by simply writing the pipeline to run in the chat. 
Optionally: it could also give information about certain results of certain Github Actions.
We may add features as soon as this proposal is accepted and we have a closer look at the Github API and the Discord bot.
