We want to make a demo on how to setup Github action to have a continuous deployment for an Android app on Google Play Store.


- Create access for Google Play Console
  - Service account on Google Cloud Platform
  - Authorize access to the app on Google Play Console
  
- Setup the Github action
  - Add actions secrets
  - Generate and sign the APK
  - Upload the release to Google Play Store
