## Topic

I want to make a demo showing the basic principles of microservices implemented using Docker containers.

I plan to implement a few basic webservers that each supply some form of service, deploy them in separate containers and finally build a service that fetches data from all the previously implemented microservises. I have not completely decided the example to be used but it will be something along the lines of: one microservice that gives you the current date, one microservice that has the name and birthdate of a few of your friends, and finally a service that uses them both to determine if one of your friends have their birthday today. Just a simple example to explore the concepts of containters and microservices!
