## Description

We will produce a demo of an example of a MLOps enviroment. The demo will start with a sprintboard containing different ML models that can be used to increase the product value. One ML model will then be pushed to GitHub, and then different tests will be run on the model producing benchmark results. If the benchmarking results are good enough the build will be deployed and we will run the ML model as part of the demo.
