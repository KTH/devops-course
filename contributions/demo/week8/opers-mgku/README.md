**Relevance**

As almost every project is saved as a repository somewhere, certain risks are implied and follows. With the rise of generative AI, such as GitHub Copilot and GPT, which samples code from different places (as well as user input), it is important to maintain any established copyright of your code. There is a current legal discussion about whether generated code belongs to you, and who shall be responsible in the events of copyright disputes. In general, however, by storing your code somewhere else there is always a risk implied, and thus it is good to now to protect yourself.
