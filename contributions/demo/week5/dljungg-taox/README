## Description

We would like to show how to Use Ansible to Automate Initial Server Setup on Ubuntu 20.04 step by step. We will demonstrate how to use Ansible for automating the initial tasks that should be executed on a fresh server, such as creating a non-root user with sudo access, enabling UFW and disabling remote password-based root login.

Relevance
Server automation now plays an essential role in systems administration, due to the disposable nature of modern application environments. Automating the initial server setup can save you time, while also making sure your servers will follow a standard configuration that can be improved and customized to your needs. With the distributed nature of modern applications and the need for more consistency between different staging environments, automation like this becomes a necessity.
