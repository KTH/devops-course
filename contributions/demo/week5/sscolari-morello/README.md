## Description

Mars introduces a novel way to write deployment configurations. Programmers easily state what contracts should exist and what parameters should they take. Additionally precise calls can be made that bring the system to a desired state.<br/>
The demo will consist in a showcase of how Mars can be used to easily deploy smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.<br/>
We will show a deployment configurations for a simple Smart Contract, and execute it in a simulated deployment environment. 

*Relevance*

This demo on Mars will showcase the relevance of infrastructure-as-code for managing blockchain applications, which often require complex and distributed infrastructure.
