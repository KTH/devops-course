## Description

Using Terraform to create a Spotify playlist as an application of Infrastructure as Code (IaC) demonstrates how we can automate the management of infrastructure through code. This can then be transitioned to OpenTofu, an open-source Terraform fork, to highlight flexibility in tool choice within a DevOps pipeline.

**Relevance**

OpenTofu is a fork of Terraform that was created after HashiCorp, the company behind Terraform changed the licensing model. OpenTofu retains the same core functionality as Terraform but is community-driven and free from licensing restrictions. Transitioning from Terraform to OpenTofu for managing the Spotify playlist highlights the ability to switch tools without drastically changing the overall workflow. The configuration files remain largely the same, demonstrating tooling flexibility and the importance of open-source alternatives in DevOps environments. Using Terraform/OpenTofu to manage a Spotify playlist makes the process more collaborative. Anyone with access to the codebase can propose changes to the playlist, enabling more structured and transparent change management between teams.
