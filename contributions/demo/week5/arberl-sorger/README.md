## Description

In this demo, we'll demonstrate how to use `Ansible` to automate the deployment of an application. This approach is useful when setting up multiple instances of the same application for development, testing, and production. The demo will show how `Ansible playbooks` can automatically configure all instances in a consistent manner, ensuring the same setup across every environment.

**Relevance**

This demo is highly relevant to DevOps because it showcases how automation tools like Ansible can streamline the deployment process, ensuring consistency across multiple environments. By automating infrastructure and configuration management, it reduces the risk of human error and allows teams to quickly deploy and scale applications in development, testing, and production environments.
