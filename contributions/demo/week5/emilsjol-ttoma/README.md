## Description

We are going to demonstrate using Terraform for infracture as code to automate cloud infracture provisioning in aws or azure. We will show examples of how to deploy and mange aws or azure servers using terraform. We will demonstrate why terraform is efficent compared to other methods.

**Relevance**

In DevOps it is essential that deploymens are done fast, reliable and consistent, Terraform is a popular tool which is used to manage infracture as code and allows the developers to define how they want their infracture set up via a config file and then deploy it to the cloud service. This reduces manual errors and makes it easier to scale and maintain the infracture.
