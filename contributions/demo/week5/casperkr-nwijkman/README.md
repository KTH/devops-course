## Description

The goal of this assignment is to demonstrate how to automate the deployment of a web application to AWS using Serverless and Terraform. The web application will be a simple static website that displays a message. The deployment will be done using the Serverless framework and Terraform. The Serverless framework will be used to deploy the Lambda function that serves the website, and Terraform will be used to deploy the S3 bucket that hosts the website. Additionally, we will also have a database that will be destroyed during the demonstration. We will also demonstrate changing a serverless API endpoint and deploying it to AWS.
