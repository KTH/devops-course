## Description

We will demo [AIAC](https://github.com/gofireflyio/aiac), a tool which makes use of generative AI tools,
generating infrastucture-as-code "templates, configurations, utilities, queries and more via LLM providers
such as OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock and Ollama".
Our idea is, besides first briefly presenting the tool itself and its capabilities, take one
previously-thought-of prompt and try it in front of the class, and then ask one of our colleagues and/or
one of the teachers for another prompt, and reason regarding the obtained results in both cases (whether they
were good, if re-prompting with a few tweaks should fix basic issues, if it hallucinated, etc).

**Relevance**

Our demo will aim to display this tool's (and generative AI tools' more generally) capabilities
of generating serviceable IaC, and how these may help developers toward their goals (taking, of course,
into consideration that these are fallible tools, with no built-in formal validity/correcteness checks).
