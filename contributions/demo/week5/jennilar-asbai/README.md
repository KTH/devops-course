## Description

We will demo how to define input and output variables in Docker images using Terraform, and describe how this can be used in different cases.

The demo will have the following outline:
    - Introduction to Terraform/Docker.
    - How to define input variables.
    - How to define output variables and query data.
    - Summary and take aways.

**Relevance**

Terraform is a infrastructure-as-code tool for building and changing infrastructure safely, and we aim to show hos this tool can be used with a popular container orchestration tool like Docker. Input and output variables are two key components of managing containers, as they give more flexibility and custom configuration.
