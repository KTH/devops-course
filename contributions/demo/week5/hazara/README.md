## Description

I will demo the interplay between AWS and Terraform. This will showcase the power and ease of implementing infrastructure as code in a DevOps workflow. 

**Relevance**

Terraform is a widely-used infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tool that enables users to create, update, and destroy infrastructure resources efficiently. By leveraging Terraform with AWS, developers and operations teams can manage infrastructure consistently and transparently, making it an essential component of a modern DevOps workflow.
