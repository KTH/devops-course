## Description

We will demonstrate how Poetry simplifies Python dependency management, from adding/removing dependencies to automatically updating configuration files, i.e. `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`. Additionally, we will showcase more advanced features like dependency grouping, selective installation, and Poetry scripting to automate additional dependency related tasks. We'll also show how to export dependencies to `requirements.txt` for compatibility with other tools. The demo will highlight Poetryâ€™s capabilities in dependency resolution and version constraints, paired with sample Docker deployment to showcase Poetry's seamless integration with containerization workflows.

**Relevance**

Automatic dependency management tools are widely used today, it is a crucial part of DevOps due to its efficiency in syncing environments across different machines. Tools like Maven and Gradle for Java are popular and industry standard. However, less people are aware that there are also such tools for Python, a more environment relied language. By leveraging Poetry's powerful dependency management capabilities and integrating it with containerization platforms, such as Docker, developers can ensure consistent and reproducible Python environments across development, testing, and production stages.
