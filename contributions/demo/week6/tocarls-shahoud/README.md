## Description

We want to demo dependabot, it is a tool that scans imported libraries for vulnerabilities, we want to demo how dependabot will automatically create pull requests when an imported library shows a vulnerability. This is very beneficial with keeping your applications more secure from vulnerable code that is not directly under your control.

**Relevance**

This let's organisations automatically check their applications for security vulnerabilities and therefore is a valuable tool for DevSecOps.
