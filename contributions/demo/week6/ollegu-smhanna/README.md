## Description

RetireJS is an open-source tool that can detect the use of JavaScript library versions with known vulnerabilities when developing a web application. By integrating the scan into a Github CI/CD pipeline via Github Actions, it would mitigate the risks from vulnerable libraries early in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). Modifications/uses of RetireJS within Github for further security measures will also be demonstrated.

_Relevance
With the growing number of Javascript libraries on the web and Node.js applications, it is easier to unknowingly choose insecure libraries during development. Automating the vulnerability detection in the CI/CD pipeline by integrating RetireJS, would earlier mitigate the risks of security breaches from these vulnerable libraries, such as Cross-Site Scripting or Remote Code Execution attacks, and thus would be a relevant aspect within DevSecOps.
