## Description

We plan to demonstrate how [StepSecurity Harden-Runner](https://github.com/step-security/harden-runner) can be implemented to harden the security of GitHub Actions runners. We will showcase how to mitigate and detect different attacks, such as supply chain attacks and workflow credential exfiltration. We will also briefly compare Harden-Runner to tools with similar functionality.

**Relevance**

DevOps principles, such as CI/CD, can by themselves introduce new attack vectors. A [recent example](https://adnanthekhan.com/2024/04/15/an-obscure-actions-workflow-vulnerability-in-googles-flank/) being a security researcher finding a vulnerability in the GitHub Actions workflow in an open source Google repository, which could have resulted in a supply chain attack. Our demo will showcase mitigations and detection of such attack vectors, making it relevant to DevOps, and more specifically DevSecOps.
