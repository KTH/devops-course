## Description

In this demo we will:
  - setup a Bitwarden Secret Manager project 
  - add a new user to the organization/project
  - add a new secret to the project
  - integrate the secrets created with Github Actions

At the end we will also give a brief explanation on why someone should use Bitwarden secret manager rather than the secrets in GitHub actions.

**Relevance**

This type of tool is very important when it comes to DevSecOps since it streamlines the process of managing secrets and deploying them at scale. It also provides a good way to integrate said secrets into Github Actions which is very useful when it comes to Continuous Integration.
