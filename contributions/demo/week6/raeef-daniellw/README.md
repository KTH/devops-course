## Description

We'll be showing how integrating SonarQube with GitHub Actions can help developers automatically discover potential security flaws in their applications. Before the demo we'll set up a repo with GitHub Actions that automatically run a sonar scan upon pushing new code. 

During the demo we'll push some code with a security flaw such as not sanitizing user input which makes us vulnerable to XSS attack. We'll then show how the sonar scan detects this vulnerability 

**Relevance**

Using GitHub Actions for static code analysis upon pushing to a repo is a pretty textbook example of DevOps by facilitating Continous Integration through automatic testing upon source code changes. Since we're adding the capability of identifying security flaws to our DevOps workflow it's also relevant to DevSecOps.
