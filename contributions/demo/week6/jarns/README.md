# Assignment Proposal

## Title
Observability in Action: Using honeycomb to track down a real bug

## Names and KTH ID
  - Jonathan Arns (jarns@kth.se)

## Deadline
- Week 6

## Category
- Demo

## Description
I started using the observability platform [honeycomb](https://honeycomb.io) for my [side-project](https://github.com/JonathanArns/shapeshifter) last year
to try to finally figure out an elusive problem that had been plaging my production server for months.
I would like to demonstrate this issue and how observability via honeycomb helped me track it down.

**Relevance**

Honeycomb is arguably the original observability platform, observability being an important concept in
modern devops. The demo itself will be highly relevant as well, because I will be able to show a real problem in
a real project that is virtually impossible to find out without observability, but almost trivial with it.
