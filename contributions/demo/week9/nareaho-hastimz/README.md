## Description

GitHub have built their own search engine from scratch, specifically for code search, to help traverse over 200 million repositories. 
The new search engine is more advanced and allows for further refinement and exploration of the code. 

This demo aims to showcase some of the features that this new search engine brings, and we will use it to discover and explore some code.

**Relevance**

Code search is an important tool for getting answers about code, through searching, browsing and reading code. The scale of GitHub is very large, so the quality of the search engine is very important.
