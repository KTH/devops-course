## Names and KTH ID

  - Ayman Osman Abubaker (aymanoa@kth.se)

## Deadline
- Week 9

## Category

- Demo

## Description

This demo will showcase the use of Chaos Engineering techniques within a DevOps environment to proactively identify and mitigate system failures. 
We will simulate real-world failures by injecting faults into a Kubernetes cluster running a sample application. 
The tools we will use for this demo include Gremlin, a popular Chaos Engineering platform, and Prometheus for monitoring the application.

**Relevance**

Chaos Engineering is highly relevant to DevOps as it promotes the proactive identification of weaknesses in a system by simulating failures. 
In a DevOps environment, where rapid development and deployment cycles are the norm, it is essential to ensure that the application can withstand various failure modes.
