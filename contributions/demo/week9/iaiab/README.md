# Assignment Proposal

## Title

Chaos Engineering via Simmy in .NET

## Names and KTH ID

- Ibrahim Abdelkareem (iaiab@kth.se)

## Deadline

- Week 9

## Category

- Demo

## Description
Chaos Engineering tests system resiliency by intentionally introducing failures, helping to identify and address potential weaknesses before they cause real-world issues. 

Simmy is a chaos engineering library that can help developers injecting faults in their .NET applications. In this demo I'll use a simple distributed system of 2 web applications that communicate with each other and a MongoDB database. I'll then show you how to use the simmy library to inject faults such as slow responses from one of the web applications or crashing the database server to test how our application will react.

**Relevance**

Chaos Engineering is relevant to DevOps as it helps developers to detect system weaknesses and flaws in order to address them and increase the reliability and confidence in the system.
