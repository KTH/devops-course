## Agenda

Setting up cypress goes in 20 seconds and is not particilarly interesting.
But the cypress dashboard is, and allows the tests to run in parallel.
This requires some extra thought while designing your tests, but provides you with massive improvments.
I feel like a video will get across how to do these things while keeping the attention of the fellow students,
and others who find the video across the internets.
