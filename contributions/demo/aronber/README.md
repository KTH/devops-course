## Agenda

Setting up cypress goes in 20 seconds and is not particularly interesting.
Doing it in parallel is however not as straight forward.
The Cypress dashboard allows to visuallyze the tests running in parallel.
I feel like a video will get across how to do these things while keeping the attention of the fellow students.
