## Topic:
The demo will shows how to integrate docker in a React Native application in a video. It shows how to dockerize the different elements of the application.

This is related to DevOps as docker helps running applications in any environment as it puts the code in containers which virtualizes the operating system of the application. Docker seems to be better than using virtual machines in terms of efficiency,scalability and performance. In DevOps it is important that you can have an ecosystem of practises that automate the work between development and testing and therefore Docker provides that ecosystem in an efficient way.

The demo is relevant to teach people to use docker.

## Changes after Feedback:
After recieving Feedback after demo day we implemented the following changes:

- Removed unnecessary word "out" from 2:23
- Added a minor informational note about the app and limitations about the app explaining why we use the web app in the demonstration
- Zoom Effects were added into the visual studio segments to make it easier to read the codes and file creation steps
- Improved the audio levels of the background music and decreased it so it does not take over the voice over. 
- Adjusted the voice over volumes to ensure that they are heard clealy
