# Michelin Devops Demo Day

## The concept

Students prepare top-notch demonstrations. The demonstrations are really DevOps (typically involve mutliple virtual machines, likely deployed in the cloud). A demonstration is scripted and lasts 3-5 minutes. Students come with a monitor (or a laptop in best-effort mode). Students are required to prepare a screencast of the demo (in case of problems, such as demo effect, persons who cannot attend to all demos, etc).

There will be two sessions, each one  with half of the students. During a session, the other half of the students, plus the course teaching team, plus invited guests (colleagues, etc) go from demos to demos, in small informal groups. 

Among the guests, some are "critique" (in the sense of [culinary critique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_critic)), they are here to assess the relevance, the difficulty, the sublime and the originality of the demo. As food critique, those critiques are anonymous: as a presenter you do not know if a person in the audience is critique or not.  Some students will be randomly assigned the critique role on a voluntary basis.

## How to Register your Demo

Make a pull-request based on the following steps:

- create a folder following the name convention of using email addresses of two members: email-email
- in your folder, create a README.md file and put your topic information there

A TA will review the PR. If it is accepted, you could begin your work on this topic, and make another pull-request to submit your screencast later.
