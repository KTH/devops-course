## Proposal
I want to create a video demo on how to leverage Kubernetes and Docker for a Microservice Infrastucture. My plan currently would be to use GKE and to create aprox 4-6 containers.

Currently, I have no clear idea what kind of application I want to build but I want it to leverage the Microservice Architechture to the maximum.

The Services I am currently thinking about:

- 1 Frontend
- 1 Auth Service for Authentication
- 1 Service which has a small Node.js backend
- 1 Service with a C# backend
- 1 Container with a SQL DB
- 1 Container with a MongoDB instance

Possibly if I have time I would love to create a Terraform Template that automatically allocates these resrouces for me and possibly try and setup a CI/CD integration for my frontend(these will only happen if I have time)
