# Michelin Devops Demo Day

The deadline for the demo is the Michelin Devops Demo Day: the demo must be ready for May 5 2020, 9h00 Stockholm time.

Annoucement: due to COVID-19, the Michelin Devops Demo Day will take place online, the grading criteria will be updated.

The hard deadline for the final submission of the Devops Demo: the demo can be updated based on peer feedback before Sunday May 10, 2020, 17h CET.

## The concept

Students prepare top-notch demonstrations. The demonstrations are really DevOps (typically involve mutliple virtual machines, likely deployed in the cloud). A demonstration is scripted and lasts 3-5 minutes. Students come with a monitor (or a laptop in best-effort mode). Students are required to prepare a screencast of the demo (in case of problems, such as demo effect, persons who cannot attend to all demos, etc).

There will be two sessions, each one  with half of the students. During a session, the other half of the students, plus the course teaching team, plus invited guests (colleagues, etc) go from demos to demos, in small informal groups. 

Among the guests, some are "critique" (in the sense of [culinary critique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_critic)), they are here to assess the relevance, the difficulty, the sublime and the originality of the demo. As food critique, those critiques are anonymous: as a presenter you do not know if a person in the audience is critique or not.  Some students will be randomly assigned the critique role on a voluntary basis.

## Online demo day of Week 7

The 4 hours session of Week 7 is as follows:

* Before the day, we consolidate a list of all demo PRs together with the corresponding Youtube URLs pointing to the screencast
* We start at 9h15 with the usual Zoom meeting
* For each screencast, three persons register themselves to give feedback, by self-assigning on the original demo PRs
* Each author of a demo screencast verifies that there are three persons registered to give feedback.
* When this is done, we close the Zoom audio-video link and go full on Github
* We all look at the screencasts and give detailed, constructive feedback by posting on the demo PRs. A conversation between the screencast author and the feeback givers happen on Github
* At 12h15, we connect back to Zoom to debrief the session


## How to Register your Demo

Make a pull-request based on the following steps:

- create a folder following the name convention of using email addresses of two members: email-email
- in your folder, create a README.md file and put your topic information there

A TA will review the PR. If it is accepted, you could begin your work on this topic, and make another pull-request to submit your screencast later.
