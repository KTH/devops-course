## How to Submit
Make a pull-request based on the following steps:

- create a folder named with your kth account (without `@kth.se`, if your work is done in a group, join everyone's name with `+`)
- in your folder, create a READEME.md file and put your topic information there

TA will review the PR. If it is accepted, you could begin your work on this topic, and make another pull-request to submit your work in the future.
