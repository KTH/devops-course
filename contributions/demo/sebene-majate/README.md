## Description
Our video demonstrates how to set up a simple CI pipeline with [Drone](https://www.drone.io/) for repos on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org). We show how to configure your own Drone server to connect to a specific Bitbucket repo and demonstrate how Drone will automatically start building your code whenever you push to the repo.

## Subject motivation
The demonstration is clearly relevant to the DevOps subject. One major part of DevOps is automation, which is what Drone helps achieve.

## Criteria that we want to fulfil
- **The demonstration is clearly motivated**
  - See motivation in section [Subject motivation](#subject-motivation).
- *The demonstration is difficult to do*
- **The demonstration is original** (with distinction)
  - There are short demos showing how to setup a drone server with Github, but we cannot find a single video demo online actually demonstrating all steps to configure a CI pipeline with Drone together with Bitbucket.
- **The video contains an easter egg**
  - The C++ program in our repo prints out the link to the DevOps github page. This print can be seen in the build log in Drone at the end of the video.
- *The video is sublime (eg visually appealing)*
- *The video must contain subtitles which are clear and in proper English*
- *The video includes a take-home message*
