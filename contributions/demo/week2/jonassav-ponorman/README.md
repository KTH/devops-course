## Category

_Demo_


## Description

_The demo will serve as a way for everyone to get familiar with the fundamentals of using Continous Integration with automatic building and testing of a simple Java application using the build tool Gradle with GitHub Actions. We will talk about the requirements of automatic build tools and demonstrate one configuration by adding dependencies and creating the workflow yml-files to build and test the simple application on different operating systems upon a Push or Pull Request to the default branch. The use of the GitHub Actions results will be shown in a 'dummy' Pull Request where our test suite now indicates that the added feature is ready to be merged without breaking the application._
