## Description

We would like to showcase gitStream (https://docs.gitstream.cm/) and how to use it to automate the reviewing process and increase productivity in your project. All pull requests are not equal, some can be handled fully automatically (like requests only modifying documentation or similarly) while others have to be reviewed by specific people on the team. The tool is quite new and seems to have been made public some time late last year.

* Automatically assign reviewers to certain pull requests.
* Automatically label pull requests with appropriate labels depending on what files/lines of code have been changed.
* Automatically approve PR:s according to specified rules.

**Relevance**
One of the goals of gitStream is to simplify continous merging which is important for continous integration. Since the bystander effect is a common problem in why code reviews takes so long gitStream has several features to alleviate this problem. The CI/CD pipeline becomes more automated and in turn, developers can focus more on writing code rather than book-keeping.
