## Description

There exist many CI tools in the DevOps field but one of the most simple tools to set up is Github actions. This demo will thus:

* Set up a Github action CI together with some frequently used tools
* The building tools in this case will be maven paired with docker
* Set up a simple java program with some tests
* Make some valid and invalid pull requests for Github action to build/test


**Relevance**

Github actions is a free to use CI/CD tool that is easy to use but also contains many functionalities for more advanced usage. A good tool for Devops engineers to know about. It allows DevOps teams to build and test their code more efficiently. Since it contains many different functionalities it can be used to customize workflows and it can also be integrated with platforms and services commonly used in DevOps.

Maven is a commonly used build tool that manages dependencies and automates the build process. It is also commonly used in DevOps since it ensures consistency of the code.

Docker is a platform that enables developers to use applications on any system that supports it by packaging the application in a container. It is relevant to DevOps since it gives a standardized environment to run the application on and therefore makes collaboration much easier.
