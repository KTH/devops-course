## Description

TestNG is an open-source testing framework for Java that is used for automated testing. It provides a number of powerful features to write and execute tests.
Some of the functionalities of TestNG are.

- Annotations: TestNG provides annotations that can be used to specify the behavior of test methods, classes, and groups.
- Grouping: TestNG provides the ability to group tests. This allows the user to run a specific group of tests or exclude a specific group of tests.
- Dependency Management: TestNG allows the user to specify the dependencies between the test methods.
- Data-Driven Testing: TestNG supports data-driven testing, which means that the same test can be run with different input data, making it easier to test multiple scenarios.
- Parallel Execution: TestNG allows the user to run tests in parallel. This can significantly reduce the time required to execute a large number of tests.
- Test Reporting: TestNG provides detailed test reports that include information about the test results, test duration, and any failures or errors that occurred during the test execution.
- Integration with Build Tools: TestNG integrates well with build tools such as Maven and Ant, making it easy to include the test suite in the build process.

In summary, TestNG provides a rich set of functionalities that can help developers and testers to write and execute tests efficiently.

**Relevance**

TestNG supports automation of tests, which can help to reduce the time and effort required to perform manual testing. This is particularly useful in DevOps, where speed and efficiency are key.
