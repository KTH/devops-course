## Deadline

- Week 2

## Category

## Description

Clever Cloud is a platform where applications and add-ons (such as databases) can be hosted. This demo would:

* Demonstrate how to set up both a MySQL database and a Spring Boot application connected to the database on Clever Cloud with continuous deployment
* Demonstrate how to ensure Maven can build and run the Spring Boot application
* Demonstrate how to add and fetch data using the Spring Boot app (by making curl requests to the Clever Cloud url)
* Demonstrate the Continuous Deployment by making a change to the Spring Boot app and pushing to GitHub (NOTE: Only if I have enough time at the end of the demo since this part probably takes at least 1-2 min)


**Relevance**

Cloud hosting is relevant to DevOps because it offers an easy way to scale databases and applications where storage and computing capacity can be adjusted easily depending on need and budget. 

CD is also useful and relevant to DevOps by making developers be able to deploy automatically, thus merging development with operations.
