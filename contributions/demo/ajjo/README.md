## Topic

Manage secrets and protect sensitive data using HashiCorp [Vault](https://www.hashicorp.com/products/vault/)

Most if not all of these instructions are taken directly from [HashiCorp Vault website](https://learn.hashicorp.com/vault/).
If you're interested they have many more (and better) guides on how to setup and use Vault. 

## Getting Started

To run the demo you (may) need these:

- Vault 
- Kubectl
- Minikube
- Virtualbox

If you are running `Arch` you can use the `init_dep.sh` script.

Additionally for the `AWS` demo you will need an [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/).
