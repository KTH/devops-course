## Problem area within DevOps
To test you scripts for custom-written github actions you are forced to push them to the github 🤦‍♀️ That is time consuming and unproductive!

## Solution to it 
with help of open source project Nektos Act and Docker you can run, test and debug your actions locally!

## Agenda for demo 

 - ✅    How Act work
 - ✅    Installing Act
 - ✅    Usage
 - ✅    Handling Secretes
 - ✅    Let´s run it together
 - ✅    Take away
