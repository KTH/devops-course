## Continous development, delivery and pipelines with CircleCI

We want to demonstrate how to integrate and use continous delivery and continous deployment with CircleCI. 
We will provide a GitHub repository together with our screencast. The viewer can fork the repo and will be provided two branches, one with a complete implementation and one unfinished setup.

We will show how new features can be delivered into an existing app.
We will highlight some features that make CircleCI a strong competitor within continous deployment and some features that facilitate the migration from Jenkins to CircleCI. 

Hopefully (if we manage to pull it off), we will show some examples of integration with Docker and Kubernetes.
