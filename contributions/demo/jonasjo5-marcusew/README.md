## About

We demonstrate how to integrate and use continous deployment on a GitHub repository with CircleCI.
The service is hosted om Google Cloud Platform, using Google Kubernetes Engine.

We show how new features can be delivered into an existing, running app.

We have provided a GitHub template repository together with our screencast. The viewer can fork the repo and follow the steps shown in the video. The screencast has sound to facilitate viewing the code and terminal use in the video.
