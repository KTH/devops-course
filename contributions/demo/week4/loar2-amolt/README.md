## Description

For our demonstration, we will show how you set up and run a serverless service deployed with a REST API. We will be using Serverless framework and AWS to set up the service. 
For demo purposes we will add a database to the service and we will showcase adding a GET and a POST endpoint. 

**Relevance**
A serverless architecture is becoming more and more popular among developers. It is more cost effective, easy to maintain and more scalable than using containers. Seeing that almost 40% of organizations are using serverless architecture, it looks to be an important player in the DevOps landscape.
