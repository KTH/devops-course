## Description

Our demo will include end-to-end testing for web apps utilizing Playwright (https://playwright.dev/). It will demonstrate a couple of smart ways to use Playwright to enhance your end-to-end tests. In our demo, we will start by showing how quickly and easily you can get started with Playwright. We will then live-write a few frontend tests in a pre-prepared repository. By running the tests, we will show how Playwright works and utilizes cross-browser testing. Finally, we plan to demonstrate how you can add Playwright testing to your CI pipeline with GitHub Actions.

Plan B:
If something doesn't work during our demo we will have screen recordings prepared to show. 

_Relevance_

This tool is an end-to-end frontend testing framework that is widely used in the industry. We believe that this tutorial could be useful for CS students and others who are not very versed in software testing tools for the web.
