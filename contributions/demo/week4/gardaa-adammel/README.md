## Description

Gatsby is a framework for developing web apps, and is built on top of React and GraphQL. It has its own cloud called Gatsby Cloud that is specialized in creating fast and easily implemented serverless functions for Gatsby web apps.

The demo will show how easy it is to make a website with a button connected to a serverless function, using Gatsby Cloud. It is relevant, as serverless functions are popular to use due to its scalability, fast development and easy integration.
