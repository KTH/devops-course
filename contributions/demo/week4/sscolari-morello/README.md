## Description

Selenium Grid is a smart proxy server that makes it easy to run tests in parallel on multiple machines and manages different browser versions and browser configurations centrally (instead of separately, in individual tests).<br/>
In particular, we want to demonstrate how Selenium tests can be run in paralell on different machines for both cross-platform and cross-browser testing. For testing we will be using TestNG.

**Relevance**

UI Automation Tests are an integral part of the DevOps environment. Through the use of Selenium Grid, and it's simple Hub-Node architecture, it's possible to parallelize testing while performing such tests on different machines. This is important to both improve the efficiency itself, by speeding up the testing process, while also making it possible to easily execute cross-platform UI automation tests.
