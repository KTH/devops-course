## Description
Like Docker, Podman is a containerization tool that allows developers to create, run, and manage containers. Unlike Docker it can, among other things, run as non-root out of the box since it does not need a running Docker deamon. 

This demo will show how a developer could switch to use Podman instead of Docker and take advantage of the benefits that brings with it.

Podman is a tool that manages containers and services, which are the foundation of these modern application development paradigms.
