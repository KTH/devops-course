## Description

Showcase how a container can be minified by a significant degree using DockerSlim. DockerSlim is created by slim.ai,
which has a GUI that we will showcase. It provides additional functionality like providing an SBOM, CVE scanning and
additional statisitics and insights. 

(We are still discussing what to put into a 7 minute demo)

**Relevance**

Everything is containerised these days and having "slim", optimised and secure containers are becoming more relevant. 
Before shipping to production, it is essential to secure your containers and this can be done by finding and reducing 
vulnerabilities in the software. Automating this process saves times and the slmi.ai GUI makes it easy to use. Gain 
insights into what’s actually in your containers with deep container analysis of layers, packages and metadata.
