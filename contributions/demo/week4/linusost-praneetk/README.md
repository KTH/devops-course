## Description

We will be showcasing how a container can be minified by a significant degree using DockerSlim. We will demonstrate 
how Docker and DockerSlim are used to minify or slimming an image so that the containerised image is ready for 
production, but in an optimised manner. We will show the difference in container image size and show that 
vulnerabilites have been reduced to make the image more secure.We will also demonstrate the easy of use of the 
Docker and Slim tools.

**Relevance**
DockerSlim is created by slim.ai, which has a GUI that we will showcase. It provides additional functionality like 
providing an SBOM, CVE scanning andadditional statisitics and insights. Everything is containerised these days and 
having "slim", optimised and secure containers are becoming more relevant. Before shipping to production, it is 
essential to secure your containers and this can be done by finding and reducing vulnerabilities in the software. 
Automating this process saves times and the slmi.ai GUI makes it easy to use. Gain insights into what’s actually 
in your containers with deep container analysis of layers, packages and metadata.
