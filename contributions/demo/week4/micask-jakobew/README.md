## Description
Docker extensions is a new feature of the Docker Desktop that was launched in the middle of 2022. It enables Docker users to easily install various extensions that help the development and management of containers. These vary from e.g debugging tools to vulnerability checkers.

Our demo aims to show how easy it is to integrate Docker extensions into one's workflow, as well as showcase an example of an extension and how it improves container development. We will install and utilize the “log viewer” extension to show how it can be used for debugging purposes when maintaining a service that depends on multiple Docker containers.

**Relevance**

Docker is a very popular tool for developing and deploying containers. Last year, Docker extensions launched for Docker desktop which we deem as a good addition to a Docker user’s workflow. Due to its relatively new release, many may not have heard of it or integrated it into their workflow yet, which we hope to change with our demo.
