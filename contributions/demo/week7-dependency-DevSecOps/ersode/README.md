## Description

[Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/) is one of the largest cloud providers worldwide. One of its services is dedicated to notifying customers when their services are exposed to a security risk, such as if a vulnerability is discovered in its software or infrastructure.

In this demo, I will walk viewers through the process of setting up an [Azure Service Health Alert](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/service-health/) to alert an [Azure Logic App](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/logic-apps/), which processes the alert, making it human-readable, before forwarding it to a [Slack](https://slack.com/) server.
