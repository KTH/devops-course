## Topic
I have come across that GitLab offers their own CI for projects, as opposed to the traditional way where you would have to integrate an external CI. I would like to create a demo on how to integrate this in an example project.

## Outline

- Background
    - What is GitLab?
    - What is a CI?
- Demo
    - How to integrate GitLab's CI in a GitLab repo
- Wrap-up
    - Reflect quickly on demo
    - Final thoughts



I aim to fulfill the criterias in bold:
