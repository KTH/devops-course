## Description

The paper "[Predicting Node Failures in an Ultra-Large-Scale Cloud Computing Platform: An AIOps Solution](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3385187)" describes the process of building an ultralarge-scale AIOps solution to combat the challenges cloud computing environments face. The process is thoroughly described and reviewed by the authors.

**Relevance**

This research is relevant to DevOps because it brings a perspective on how DevOps can leverage AI to improve resilience by reducing downtime with the help of automed node failure detection.
