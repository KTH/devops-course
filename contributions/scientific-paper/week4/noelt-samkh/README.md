## Description

This presentation will cover the findings in the paper [TinyMLOps: Operational Challenges for Widespread Edge AI Adoption](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9835378) 
The paper addresses the operational challenges of ML deployment on edge devices (TinyML). We will discuss some of the key challanges and the main problems including monitoring, deployment and security. We will 
also give an critical evaluation of the paper.   

**Relevance**

TinyMLOps is relevant to devops because it applies the principles of devops but to edge devices which are more resource constrained.
TinyMLOps focuses on automating the ML models from integration to deployment as well as monitoring updates.
