## Description

The purpose of this scientific paper presentation is to guide the audience understand the **industrial MLOps of for Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS)**, regarding **3 major challenges and corresponding solutions**, as outlined in the paper ["MLOps for Cyber-Physical Production Systems: Challenges and Solutions"](https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.focus.lib.kth.se/document/10636080/keywords#keywords). 

We will explain the **data-related**, **model-related** and **operations-related** challenges that are specific to implementing industrial MLOps for CPPS, and discuss about existing solutions. We will also go into the technical details of real applications of the solutions.

**Relevance**

The topics covered are particularly relevant to MLOps, as they address the MLOps in industrial production setting based on real industrial experience.
