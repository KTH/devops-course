## Description

Malware in package dependency chains is a big and growing issue.
The malware often differs in terms of naming and syntax, but it can be detected based on the common semantics.
We intend to present a paper regarding Semantic Malware Detection ([GENIE: Guarding the npm Ecosystem with
Semantic Malware Detection](https://www.plai.ifi.lmu.de/publications/secdev24-genie.pdf))
in the NPM ecosystem.

**Relevance**

Supply chain attacks and dependency management are one of the core parts of DevOps,
and methods and strategies for detecting malicious packages are required to keep a stable and secure supply chain going into the future.
