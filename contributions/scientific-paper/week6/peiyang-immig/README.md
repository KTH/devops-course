## Description

We plan to present the paper titled "The Seven Sins: Security Smells in Infrastructure as Code Scripts", which provides an empirical study on security smells in infrastructure as code (IaC) scripts. The authors identify seven distinct security smells, such as hard-coded secrets and invalid IP address binding, which could lead to potential security breaches. They propose a static analysis tool, Security Linter for Infrastructure as Code scripts (SLIC), to detect these smells and highlight their prevalence and persistence in real-world IaC scripts.

**Relevance**

Understanding and mitigating security smells in IaC scripts is crucial for ensuring the security and robustness of automated infrastructure management in DevOps practices such as Infrastructure as Code.
