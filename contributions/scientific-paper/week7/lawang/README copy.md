## Description

This presentation will explore the role of RefBot, an intelligent software refactoring bot that automates the refactoring process within software development. The focus will be on how RefBot leverages machine learning and artificial intelligence to identify code smells, recommend refactoring strategies, and automate code restructuring with minimal developer intervention. It will also discuss the impact of such tools on software quality, maintenance, and developer productivity.

**Relevance**

Refactoring is a crucial activity in software development that ensures long-term maintainability and scalability of codebases. However, it can be a tedious and error-prone process. RefBot aims to automate this task, reducing the cognitive load on developers and enhancing code quality.
