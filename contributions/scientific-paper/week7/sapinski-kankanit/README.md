## Description

The paper "[Building a real-world logging infrastructure with Logstash, Elasticsearch and Kibana](https://hdms.bsz-bw.de/frontdoor/deliver/index/docId/5021/file/elk_paper_patrick_kleindienst.pdf)" writes about how a company was having difficulty merging log files between all of their micro-services. They rectified this problem using ELK. 

**Relevance**

This paper is relevant because it details step-by-step how to create your own logging infrastructure. ELK is a widely used open-source toolchain for merging logs into more human-readable formats.
