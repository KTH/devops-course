## Description

 The paper [A Survey on Observability of Distributed Edge & Container-Based Microservices](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9837035) looks at state-of-the-art methods in observing microservices. 
 Monolithic applications are being shifted ever more towards microservices and those are often running on centralized cloud networks. 
 Edge computing seeks to put the processing time of data on the edge of the network, where the data is created, removing the need to send it to a centralized location. With this distribution of data and computation, it is important to maintain reliability through observing the microservices. 

**Relevance**

It is highly important in a growing distributed system infrastructure to be able to monitor each service. One service going down can have a cascading effect and developers should be aware of how to monitor that.
