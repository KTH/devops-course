## Description
Modern DevOps requires automation and flexibility to manage frequent infrastructure changes. Traditional Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools are limited to static configurations, needing manual updates for dynamic behavior. Dynamic IaC (DIaC) overcomes this by enabling real-time, automatic infrastructure adjustments based on external signals. Our presentation will showcase the authors findings about DIaC in two practical cases and introduce ProTI, a testing tool for validating dynamic IaC programs.


**Relevance**

This paper is relevant for DevOps teams seeking better automation and scalability. DIaC offers continuous adaptation for cloud infrastructures, while ProTI ensures correctness in complex dynamic environments.
