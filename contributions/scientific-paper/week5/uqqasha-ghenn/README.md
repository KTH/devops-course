## Description
This scientific paper presentation will focus on the best and bad practices of infrastructure-as-code tools from a developer's perspective as detailed in the study "[The do’s and don’ts of infrastructure code: A systematic gray literature review](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584921000720)". The paper was published in the journal 'Information and Software Technology' in 2021 and has been cited by 56 sources. The authors conduct a systemtic review of gray literature on IaC to examine how IaC is perceived and practiced by industry professionals. We will present the primary categories of IaC best and bad practices, as identified in the paper, along with their examples. These practices reflect implementation issues, design issues, and the violation of key IaC principles.


**Relevance**

This paper is relevant to DevOps as it explores the field of infrastructure-as-code from a developer's perspective and highlights the scarcity of existing academic literature in this field.
