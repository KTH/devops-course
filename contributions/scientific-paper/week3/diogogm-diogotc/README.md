## Description

Paper: [DOI: 10.1109/ICSA.2018.00013](https://doi.org/10.1109/ICSA.2018.00013) - Available through the KTH Library

The paper we intent to present summarizes experiences from Paddy Power about how
microservices architecture has been adopted in a Continuous Delivery context.
It highlights the substancial advantages of microservices - higher deployability,
modifiability, and better resilience - but also discusses the challenges introduced
by microservices - including the complexity of managing a larger number of services,
evolving service contracts, and handling the diversity of technologies.
To address this challenges, practical strategies are presented such as automated CD
pipelines and robust contract management.
The paper concludes by calling for further research in areas like managing service
interactions, refactoring service boundaries, and exploring alternative architectural
styles when microservices may not be suitable.

**Relevance**

Continuous deployment is a main topic of DevOps, but it is not always easy to implement
for every project.
Microservices, as presented in this paper, are an alternative to the common monolithic
approach that promises to solve roadblocks in the implementation of CD for software
projects.
