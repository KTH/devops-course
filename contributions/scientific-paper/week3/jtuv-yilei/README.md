## Description

In this scientific paper presentation, based on the article [An Empirical Study of Architecting for Continuous Delivery and Deployment](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08796), we will explore how software architecture design interacts with the practices of Continuous Delivery and Deployment. Further more we will discuss how to (re-) architect software to work well in a CD context.

**Relevance**

This topic is relevant for DevOps because the architecture of your code base can heavily impact how well adopting and using CD works. One example of this is that while the study found that CD can still be used with monoliths, it makes the process significantly more challenging than “small and independent deployment units”. And these findings are backed up with empirical evidence, and complemented with a conceptual framework for the process of (re-) architecting for CD.
