## Description
This scientific presentation will explore the practical implementation and challenges of Microservice Architectures (MSA) as detailed in the study ["Revisiting the practices and pains of microservice architecture in reality: An industrial inquiry"](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0164121222001972?ref=cra_js_challenge&fr=RR-1). We will examine how MSAs function in real-world scenarios and investigate their relationship with continuous delivery and deployment practices. The presentation will show both the benefits and obstacles encountered when adopting MSA in industrial settings.

**Relevance**
This topic is important for understanding modern DevOps practices and Continuous Delivery/Continuous Deployment (CD/CD) pipelines. MSAs have become increasingly common in today's DevOps landscape, largely replacing traditional monolithic architectures. MSAs allow for more efficient scaling of individual components, enable easier updates and modifications to specific services without affecting the entire system, and make failures in one microservice less likely to spread throughout the entire application. By using MSAs, organizations can separate different aspects of their infrastructure, thereby improving the processes of continuous delivery and deployment since individual teams can work independently on their respective microservices. This presentation will provide insights into how MSAs are reshaping delivery/deployment strategies in DevOps environments.
