## Description
This project is developed for gathering information regarding COVID-19 to update the users. It is totally non-profit-oriented project which emphasis on novelty and helping the people by providing all related information about COVID-19. Both students and people from the community can support by using this web portal. This web app is integrated with the latest Microsoft cloud platform by using Azure DevOps and Azure WebServices. As a result, this app can ensure low cost and high efficiency.
## Motivation
Due to the coronavirus lockdown, everyone is affected whether a normal person or a KTH student/employee. It is important to keep updated with COVID19 situation from time to time. Moreover, if a person is confirmed with COVID19 positive, or has COVID19 symptom, he/she needs emergency contacts with the local healthcare. Besides, a student/employee needs an update about the courses or the instruction during the lockdown situation. All of these current facts have motivated us to create a web portal where it can serve the latest information regarding Covid19 update, emergency contact information based on the local community, KTH students support about the curses or admission. This website could promote fundraising for the WHO as well as locally which would be spent to help and support COVID19 affected people or students.
