## Topic
Visualizing the places visited by infected people in Lithuania and matching them with Google Location history

## About the project
Last month we participated in [HackTheCrisis](https://hackthecrisis.lt/) hackathon in Lithuania and together with other team members built a project to visualize previously visited places by the infected people.
This data is provided by the Lithuanian government, but in very inconvenient format, so we visualized it on the map. 
We also created a feature to upload your Google Location history and see which infected places you visited. 
Apart from that, we worked with some epidemiologists and built a model, which calculates the likelihood of being infected depending on distance and time passed between your and the infected person's visits.
Based on the location data, we also calculate the amount of time spent outside, that way encouraging the people to better follow the quarantine.
We won the hackathon and afterwards we were contacted by [EurovaistinÄ—](https://www.eurovaistine.lt/) - the biggest pharmacy chain in Lithuania. We are now planning to work with them to display in our website the availability of masks in their pharmacies.
The project is hosted using [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) at [sekvirusa.lt](https://sekvirusa.lt).
The website is completely in Lithuanian language, but I think you should understand the main idea. It uses Continuous Deployment using Netlify.
