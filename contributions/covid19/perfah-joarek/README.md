## Description
Write a python-script that fetches [official CSV-data from DGG (Myndigheten för digital förvaltning)](https://www.dataportal.se/sv/datasets/525_1424/antal-fall-av-covid-19-i-sverige-per-dag-och-region) on the number of COVID-19 cases per Swedish region/county. The script will then show a graph presenting the development of newly confirmed cases.

## Motivation
The official website from Folkhälsomyndigheten does not show newly confirmed cases per region/county in graph-form. It would be a nice addition to be able to see a plot on the development in specific regions since it is hard to see trends from data sheets.

## Ties to DevOps
We will use the following DevOps technologies in the development of the script:
- GitHub
- Continous Integration (Travis)
