Corona FAQ Mobile Application

Idea is to develop a mobile application that will have a dictionary of the most of the frequently asked questions about the virus and their answers. Data will be obtained from https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses and https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/covid-19/. 

The app will have a nice interface to easily navigate to different sections of the dictionary. 

#Technologies to be used
1. React Native
2. Azure DevOps to for CI/CD pipeline
