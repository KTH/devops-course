# Completed Task: Corona-FAQs Android Application

Idea is to develop a mobile application that will have a dictionary of the most of the frequently asked questions about the virus and their answers. Data will be obtained from https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/q-a-coronaviruses and https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/the-public-health-agency-of-sweden/communicable-disease-control/covid-19/. 

The app will have a nice interface to easily navigate to different sections of the dictionary. 

#Technologies to be used
1. React Native
2. Github, Azure DevOps and App Center for CI/CD pipeline


# Completed Application
The first version of the application has been completed and published to Play Store but is still pending publication. It contains frequently asked questions and their answers in English for now. The second version will have both English and Swedish.
