## Description

Eiffel Protocol is a protocol for ci/cd that assists in the tracability of contribution with a focus on keeping track on supply chains. It makes use of "technology agnostic event-based communication" to make it easier to keep track of what is happening in the software procuction and the supply chain.

We plan to make a presentation where we show the importance of traceability in projects, in particular large ones, and how Eiffel is a possible solution to large-scale traceability across different platforms, repos, and pipelines. This is an adjustment of a previous proposal and explained in issue \#1667

Previous proposal:  
We plan to make a demo where we implement parts of the eiffel protocol and show off how it works and it's usefulness in tracking activity and how it can be used to track repos over multiple platforms. The demonstration could contain pushing some commits to one of several repos in a larger projeect triggering a build of some executable with several repositories.
