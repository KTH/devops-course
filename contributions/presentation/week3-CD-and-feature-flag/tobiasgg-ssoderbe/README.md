## Description

Canary Deployment is the art of deploying new features to a selected subset of your users. This concept allows companies to use a small set of users as guinea pigs for trying out new functionality. In this way you can quickly see if there are any problems with the new functionality and/or if the new functionality seems to benefit the user experince or not. This presentation will go into how Canary Deployment is used in practice and what impact it can have on users.
