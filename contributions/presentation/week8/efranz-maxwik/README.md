## Description

Vercel provides hosting and CI/CD for many different front-end frameworks. Most notably their own framework, Next.js. As Next.js has grown to become one of the world's most popular web frameworks, Vercel has also grown a lot as a company and is now one of the biggest CI/CD providers. Their serverless hosting option is a great option for quickly deploying your app to the web. Other providers such as Netlify and AWS Amplify also provide this service, but why should Vercel allow them to take market share. We believe there is a case for Vercel intentionally introducing breaking changes into Next.js (for serverless) to stay on top of the competition.

**Relevance**

As Vercel is one of the biggest CI/CD providers, we think that a discussion about this company is highly relevant for this week. We want to discuss the conflict of interest related to companies that both manage open source projects and provide CI/CD or other services related to these projects, where other companies may want to take market share by providing similar services.
