## Description
Merging can be a time consuming task in big projects with many branches. Handing each Pull Request means assinging 
reviewers, adding comments, approving and merging. On certain cases the branch must be rebased to the latest verision 
of the main branch.

Mergify is a Pull request automation tool that solves these issues, through actions that are triggered based on a set of rules. 
In this presentation we will describe how mergify is configured, how to specify actions with _rules_ and 
how Mergify can queue merging of pull requests in a sequential order.
