## Description

A brief introduction of the problem it attempts to solve when deploying new software versions. We would try to briefly cover previous (or "lesser") relevant similar methodologies such as blue/green deployment and discuss some limitations that motivate the extension, which is rainbow deployment. Such limitations may include multiple backend services serving an application or running long-term jobs that may not be interrupted blocking deployment of new versions, both cases advocating the need for more colors.

**Relevance**

We believe it's relevant to DevOps in general and in particular to the subject of week 3 as it deals with continuous deployment. We also believe no one has covered it previously in the course, although there is some coverage of blue/green deployment.
