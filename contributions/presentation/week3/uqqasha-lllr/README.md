## Description

We will give a presentation on Harness. Harness is a platform that simplifies the software delivery process making it easy to automate the CI/CD process. AI is leveraged to automatically verify every deployment and inititates rollbacks if needed. We will first give a brief overview of Harness as a platform and it's main features, with a focus on Continuous Delivery. We will also talk about how Harness uses AI and machine learning to reduce errors, optimize pipelines, and simplify deployments followed by different deployment strategies supported by Harness. And finally, we will talk about how Harness integrates with existing DevOps tools like Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

**Relevance**

This presentation is highly relevant to this week’s topic, Continuous Delivery. Continuous Delivery is a core practice in DevOps. By focusing on Harness, we will demonstrate how this platform enhances the CD process.
