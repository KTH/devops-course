## Description

We would like to address some key security risks in CI/CD pipelines, and how some of these risks can be mitigated using SonarQube Static Application Security Testing (SAST).

**Relevance**

Organizations are able to produce higher quality code more quickly by automating CI/CD throughout the development, testing, production, and monitoring stages of the software development lifecycle. Nowadays, many companies fully rely on their CI/CD pipelines in the delivery of their software. It is therefore essential that the pipeline remains secure.
