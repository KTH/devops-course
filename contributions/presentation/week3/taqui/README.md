## Proposal

I want to create a presentation of the problems that occur when a small start-up might have to think about scaling their product for larger-scale usage. I want to pretend like I was the founder of Netflix (not set in stone) and talk about the decision I would make regarding the overall infrastructure of the application. I would discuss how to leverage the cloud to enable my little start-up to easily scale to the size of a Fortune 500 Company. Important will be to explain how each aspect relates to DevOps.

The topics that will be discussed in the presentation:

- Pretend like I am a startup wanting to create a great product
- Containerization
- Start talking about aspects of scaling
- Auto-scaling 
- Load Balancing
- Elasticity
- Disaster Recovery
