## Topic
Monolithic vs Microservices

DevOps can extend its use of containerization to switch to a microservices architecture. Microservice based applications can be implemented for increased scalability and independence.

DevOps teams encapsulate pieces of functionality in microservices and build larger systems by composing the microservices like building blocks. These teams can also extend functionality by adding new microservices without affecting other parts of the application. DevOps practices, such as CI and CD, are used to drive microservice deployments.
