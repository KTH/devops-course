## Agenda
1. Motivation
1. Monolithic Architecture
1. Microservices Architecture
1. Decomposition Patterns
1. Patterns as a Graph
1. Technical Example
1. Take-home Message

## Description
In this presentation, first, we are going to talk about the difference between
Monolithic Architecture and Microservices Architecture. Then, we are going
to talk about Decomposition patterns. After that, we are going to clarify how 
to think of the relationships between patterns using a graph. Then, we are going to go through
a technical example that shows how we reflect about design decisions of an example
system when it comes to choosing between two different patterns: API Gateway pattern
and Backends for frontends pattern. Then, we will end with a take-home message.

## Criteria we want to fulfill

Here is a list of the criteria we want to fulfill:

* timing: The presentation's length is exactly in 7-9 minutes
* relevance: The presentation mostly contains relevant information
* well-structured: The presentation is well structured.
* motivation: The presentation contains a good, motivating introduction. -> we motivate why this topic is relevant to DevOps
at the beginning and that large companies such as Netflix, Amazon and Ebay use Microservices architecture.
* technical: The presentation contains one part that is deeply technical. -> we go through a detailed technical example. Architecture diagrams and Code snippets are used in the presentation.
* originality: The presentation contains one part that is original. -> The way of the reflection about the design decisions using diagrams, code snippets and a trade-off table is original. No one until now as far as we know presented patterns in this way in such a short presentation.
* Reflection: The presentation contains a reflective part. -> We go though a concrete example use case that reflects and compares between trade-offs of two patterns using diagrams, code snippets and a trade-off table.
* take-home: The last slide contains a good and concise take-home message. -> The take-home message is concrete and is grounded on facts.
* loudly: The speakers talk loudly and clearly.
* engagement: The speakers engage with the audience (eg eye-contact). -> In our example, we mark the current pattern that we are talking about with a green color at the top of the slide. Slides are also dynamic and interactive with highlighting and markings.
* humour: The speakers are fun, have humour. -> a meme in slide 26.
* readable-slides: The slides don't have too much text. -> Clear and concise text. There are clear diagrams and slides with highlighting and marking. We have slide numbers as well.
* illustration: The slides contain nice illustrations. -> Clear diagrams (illustrations), code snippets and tables with highlighting and marking exist in the slides.
