## Description

In this presentation we will explore **Canary Deployments**, focusing on how they function, as well as their key advantages. The presentation will include a comparison to the alternative blue-green deployment strategy. 

We aim to present how Canary Deployments can be used as a safe and efficient strategy for introducing changes in a production environment, preferrably using a real world example.

To summarize, we aim to cover:
- The mechanics of Canary Deployments.
- How they minimize risks during deployment.
- Example of use cases (preferrably a real-world scenario).
- A comparison with blue-green deployment.

**Relevance**

Canary Deployments are very relevant, as they allow teams to gradually introduce new changes to a subset of users, thus **reducing the risk of widespread failures**. It is therefore highly relevant for organizations aiming to achieve **continuous delivery**, by ensuring safer rollouts.
