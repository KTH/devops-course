## Motivation

With focus on application behaviour in production environment and making it sustainable to withstand turbulent situations, we would like to present on chaos engineeing and its tools. Specifically, we will be looking into the functionality of Chaos Machine, an application level chaos engineering tool that helps to build better applications. The content for the presentation will be refered from [A Chaos Engineering System for Live Analysis and Falsification of Exception-handling in the JVM](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.05246) . Making each DevOps cycle less vulnerable to failures, the chaos machine provides some impressive features and we will be diving into some technical aspects of it as well in our presentation.

## Description:

 -Introductions to fault engineering and chaos engineering and a comparison between them.
 -Performace evaluation of a spring application using chaos machine/chaos monkey.
 -A look into the tools that would be used for chaos engineering.We will delve into the different use cases for them and the different categories of tools that are available at the moment.
