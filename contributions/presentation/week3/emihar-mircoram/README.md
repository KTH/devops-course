## Description

Canary releases, feature flags and blue green deployment are similar deployment methods and can be at first glance seem interchangeable. We would like to discuss their
differences and how they might be used in different fields such as social media and the game industry. We also argue how these different methods can affect the userbase
and how they can be used to get tailor to specific use cases for the release.

**Relevance**

It's easy to learn new concept in theory but how they are applied in the real world is essential for learning how to and more importantly when to use the different
methods. Aside from explaining the methods in theory, they application and result will give insight to other student who might be experts from the computer science
perspective but lack a broader view of the use cases.
