## Description

This presentation explores the use of feature flags (also known as feature toggles). Feature flags allow developers to deploy incomplete or experimental features to production without making them visible to users. This technique reduces risk, enables faster releases, and facilitates A/B testing.

**Relevance**

Feature flags are crucial for Continuous Deployment in DevOps because they allow teams to safely deploy incomplete or experimental features. By keeping these features hidden from users until they're ready, teams can reduce risks, release faster, all of which align with the principles of rapid and continuous delivery in DevOps.
