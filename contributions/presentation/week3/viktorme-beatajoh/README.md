## Description

The focus of our presentation is to compare Kubernetes against other cloud vendor specific offerings such as, e.g., AWS ECS. We tend to hear a lot about Kubernetes and we'd like to shine a light on other options that are available in the modern cloud environment. We argue for scenarios that may fit Kubernetes and compare with other scenarios where it may be more appropriate to use a vendor specific solution.


**Relevance**

Automating the deployment step in the CI/CD pipeline is a focus of DevOps. It's easy to tunnel-vision on Kubernetes and think that it's the only choice out there - this is not the case. We want to broaden our view of other solutions and our understanding of other container orchestrators.
