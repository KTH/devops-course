## Description

**Relevance**

Automating the deployment step in the CI/CD pipeline is a focus of DevOps, and minimizing bad effects (e.g. application downtime) when deploying new software updates into a production environment is important.

Kubernetes is a well-known state-of-the-art tool for managing and deploying applications.
