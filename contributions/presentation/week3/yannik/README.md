# Reproducible Builds with Nix

[Nix](https://nixos.org) is an approach to package management facilitating a functional programming language to define how a software artifact is built.
Definitions can be combined to a point where whole system configurations can be defined and deployed deterministically (As seen in the nix based Linux distribution NixOS).
