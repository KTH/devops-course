## Description


In this presentation, we will explain the **Blue-Green Deployment** strategy used in **Continuous Deployment**. This ensures **zero downtime** during updates by maintaining two identical environments: **Blue (current)** and **Green (new)**. We will cover how traffic can be switched between these environments, ensuring seamless updates and fast rollback in case of issues. The presentation will also include its implementation in **Kubernetes** and its benefits in Long-running systems.

Relevance:

Blue-Green Deployment is a key strategy in **Continuous Deployment**, helping teams deliver seamless, risk-free updates and ensuring high availability during deployment.
