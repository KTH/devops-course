## Description

In this presentation, we will explore the fundamentals of containerization and its significance in modern DevOps practices. We'll start by discussing Docker, a leading containerization platform, and how it enables developers to package applications with all their dependencies for consistent deployment across various environments. We will then delve into Kubernetes, a powerful orchestration tool that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. This presentation will highlight how containerization accelerates development, reduces infrastructure costs, and enhances collaboration between development and operations teams, making it an essential component of the DevOps toolchain.
