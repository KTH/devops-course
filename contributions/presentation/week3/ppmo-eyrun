Topic: DevOps and security

We’ve been looking into the issue #18 (DevOps and Security) 
and would like to do a presentation of one of the topics. 
We’re still reading through the material posted in that issue and will define it further as soon as possible.

We're interested in why automated security is relevant to DevOps.
