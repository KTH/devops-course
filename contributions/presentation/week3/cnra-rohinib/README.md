## Description
In this presentation, we will explain what IoT Edge devices are and highlight the importance of Continuous Deployment (CD) in managing these devices. We'll demonstrate how CD enables automated updates to edge devices, ensuring real-time functionality and scalability. Using Azure IoT Edge as an example, we'll show how to implement CD effectively. Additionally, we'll discuss how CD for IoT Edge differs from traditional web applications, focusing on challenges like connectivity, resource constraints, and decentralized environments.

**Relevance**

As IoT Edge devices become more prevalent, the need for rapid software updates, bug fixes, security patches, and new feature rollouts across a large, distributed network of devices has grown significantly. This is where Continuous Deployment plays a crucial role. CD allows scalable, secure deployments that minimize downtime and reduce manual intervention.
