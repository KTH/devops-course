## Description

This presentation will focus on several use cases of when synthetic monitoring is a worthwhile addition to a project's CI/CD pipeline. We also want to highlight in broad terms how to implement synthetic monitoring and showcase the diversity of ----- that can be useful to developers and how they can change the development process.

**Relevance**

While creating an application that has to handle a large user-base, synthetic monitoring can be a great way to check the performance of the application while it is still in its pre-deployment phase. This way, the developer team can quickly spot what parts of the application can be problematic when faced with expected user behavior and fix them as soon as possible.
