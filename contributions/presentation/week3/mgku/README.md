## Description

I want to introduce Terraform and compare it to the (probably) more known tool of Ansible. I want to show use cases where each of the tools gets used and how they compare in the usage.

**Relevance**

IaC has become a critical component of modern software deployment. It allows devlopers to automate the process of provisioning and managing infrastructure. Terraform is one of the most popular IaC tools used, while Anisble is a widely used DevOps tool for configuration managemant and automation. In this presentation, we will explore Terraform and Ansible and compare their strengths and weaknesses.
