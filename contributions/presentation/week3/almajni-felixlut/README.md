### The relevance to devops (1-3 statement)
Code coverage is a metric that is used to measure the degree to which the source code of a program is executed by the automated tests.

DevOps is a set of practices that aims to shorten the life cycle of the systems development and to provide continuous delivery **with high software quality**.

Thus Code coverage can be seen as an important and useful tool for DevOps that
can help with identifying untested code, which can then be remedied and improve the quality of it which can also help by providing continuous delivery
