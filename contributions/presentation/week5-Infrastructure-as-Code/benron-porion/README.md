## Description
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become a common practice ensuring better scalability and consistency of infrastructures and enabling quick deployment. However, despite the many benefits of IaC, an improper IaC configuration can lead to serious deployment or security issues, especially since it may manage several systems (Kubernetes clusters for instance). In this presentation, we aim to give an insight into the best practices to adopt when implementing IaC to ensure the safety and security of your infrastructure. Tools mitigating some of those issues will be introduced.
