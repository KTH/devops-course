## Description

Today an increasing number of companies are offering digital services and migrating their existing services to a Multi-tenent SaaS platform on the public cloud.
The drivers behind this is to reduce cost of operations, reduced time to market, and scaling of capacity in order to offer service to global market.
In this presentation I will introduce the key architectural concepts required to design a successfull multi-tenent platform solution.
I will focus on the importance of tenent Identity in order to achieve complete separation between different customer tenents sharing a platfrom 
with Siloed or Pooled resources, such as containters, compute nodes and databases.
