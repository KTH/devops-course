## Description
This presentation will focus on how automated switch validation is currently achieved at Google as explained in this [research paper][1] and the preceding [talk at ONF Connect 19][2].
The basic idea is that a formal specification in P4 is used to program a virtual switch and a hardware fixed-function network switch. Both receive the same network traffic and their output is compared. A difference in output then means that an error occurred at some stage in the process.


**Relevance**

With software-defined networking and programmable switches becoming more and more common in datacenter networks, automated tests are necessary to ensure availability and correctness of the network.
