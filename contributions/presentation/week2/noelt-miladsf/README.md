- Presentation


## Description

The idea of this presentation is to showcase that the gap between developers and non-technical experts in operations
could be reduced by using BDD. We have decided to use automated front-end testing as a medium to showcase how BDD can be implemented.
The framework that we are primarily focusing on is Behave which is for Python and Selenium as the webdriver.
  

**Relevance**

This topic is relevant to DevOps because it highlights how important it is to integrate behaviour-driven development (BDD)
into the development and operational phases of the software lifecycle. By using BDD, clear executable tests are created
which ensure improvement of the overall software quality and operational efficiency.
