## Prometheus, monitor your system

We want to present on the monitoring-tool Prometheus

We aim to answer questions such as:

- What is monitoring? (briefly)
- What are metrics? (briefly)
- What is Prometheus?
- How to set up Prometheus?
- How is Prometheus used?
- What are the advantages of using Prometheus?
- What makes Prometheus different from other tools?-
