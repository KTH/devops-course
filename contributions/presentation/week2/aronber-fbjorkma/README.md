## Monitoring and why system feedback matters

We want to present on why monitoring your pipelines and automations matter,
as there seems to be an undervaluation of feedback.

We aim to answer questions such as:

- What is monitoring?
- What are metrics?
- What is the value of deploying often?
- What is the value of the feedback from the system?
- How to act upon the feedback gained from the system?
