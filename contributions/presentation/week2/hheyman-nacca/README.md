 ## Proposal
The inner workings of git

Our intention is to to give our viewers a deeper understanding of git beyond the more basic commands-and-branches understanding, such as the abstract object model that drives the functionality.
 
 Slide draft
 - Short history of git (also including purpose)
 - Why git is so succesfull
 - Branching
 - Object-model in the deeper mechanics of git
 - Why inner mechanics matter
