## Description

We want to talk about Mockito, a Java-based mocking framework, to enhance the testing automation process, specifically within the context of Continuous Integration (CI). Mockito allows developers to create mock objects for unit tests. It enables simulation of complex interactions without requiring actual dependencies.

**Relevance**

This proposal is relevant as it improves automated testing by using Mockito to simplify test development through mocking external dependencies.
