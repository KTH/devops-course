# Reproducible Builds with Nix

[Nix](https://nixos.org) is an approach to package management facilitating a functional programming language to define how a software artifact is built.
Definitions can be combined to a point where whole system configurations can be defined and deployed deterministically (As seen in the nix based Linux distribution NixOS).

## Content

- Nix (the language)
- Nix Derivations (Description of an Artifact)
- Nixpkgs (Central Package Repository)
- Example Applications of Nix
  - Integrations
  - NixOS (define a local system)
  - NixOps (deploy remote machines)

Due to timing constraints a subset of these will be presented or some points will mostly be mentioned with pointers to external resources.
