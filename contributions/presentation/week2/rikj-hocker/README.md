## Description

We want to present a hot new CI/CD called TeamCity Pipelines, a tool that is developed by a well know software development company JetBrains who are famous for their Intellij IDE, Kotlin programming language and Ktor backend service and so forth. Most CI/CD tools are developed with the intention fo being utilised by large organisations, streamlining the development process for enterprise teams, but this new software aims to simplify the process for smaller teams who may wish for less complexity and more recommendations straight from the start. 

**Relevance**

Larger CI/CD solutions usually require dedicated staff members for maintaining and administering their pipelines, whereas a smaller team would have to handle it all on their own, and thus a simplified solution can save them a great deal of time. For smaller development teams in the sizes of maybe a dozen, more efficient CI/CD solutions are growing in demand. Considering JetBrains prestigious pedigree for developing industry standard softwares as mentioned previously, it is not unlikely that TeamCity Pipelines will make a noteworthy impact on the small team development lifestyle.

Usually, example based testing is used when writing unit tests, where the programmer has to come up with various test inputs and define what the expected results are. 
This is tedious and error-prone in the long run, thus one can utilize property-based testing to speed up the processes. 
Property-based testing also explores more inputs and conditions, which makes it easier to uncover edge cases. 
This is relevant to DevOps as it concerns test automation as well as being able to significantly enhance the testing suite.
