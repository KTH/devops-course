### Are automatically generated test suites "good"?
* **Title:** Are automatically generated test suites "good"?
* **Description:** There are many proposed ways of measuring how "good" a test
  suite is, where mutation testing and code coverage are some of the most
  common. However, this is most often centered on how the test suite performs
  right now, and does not take the long-term into account. An often neglected
  point is maintainability, which may be just as important as current
  performance. This subject is especially interesting in light of recent trends
  to automatically generate test suites, where the effectiveness of such suites
  often seems to be measured purely from a current-performance point-of-view.
* **Takeaway:** There is more to the quality of a test suite than the amount of
  bugs that it can uncover, which automatically generated tests often fail to
  take into account.
