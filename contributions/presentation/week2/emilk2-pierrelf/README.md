## Description

Turborepo is a sophisticated build system that streamlines the development of JavaScript and TypeScript codebases. By utilizing caching and intelligent scheduling, it accelerates local and CI/CD development processes while minimizing idle CPU usage. Turborepo integrates with monorepo tools and its caching functionality keeps previous task outputs to prevent redundant work.

**Relevance**

DevOps principles emphasize the importance of speedy, reliable software testing and deployment. Turborepo aligns with these principles by shortening build times and increasing development efficiency. As a result, it is a valuable tool in the DevOps toolbox.
