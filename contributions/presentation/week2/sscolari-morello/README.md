## Description

Analysis of the SUPERNOVA framework for automated test selection and defect prevention. 
Overview of agent-based testing and its relevance in the gaming industry. 
Proposed novel integration of agent-based testing with the existing SUPERNOVA framework.

**Relevance**

Testing in videogames has always been a notoriously hard task, due to the dimension of the software, it's dynamicity and non-deterministic nature.
The growing complexity of games has lead to a growing difficulty in organizing and structuring testing in an effective and non cost-prohibiting way.
SUPERNOVA proposes a solution to this problem through the use of Machine Learning. On the other side, QA testing can benefit from the use of agent-based systems whom are capable of mitigating the non-deterministic aspect in videogames, making possible to automatically play and test the game searching for bugs.
