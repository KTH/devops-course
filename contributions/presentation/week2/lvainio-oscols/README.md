## Description

This presentation will start off by introducing Split and how it's relevant to this course. Followed by what A/B testing is.

We will show code snippets on how the feature flags are implemented in the production code. And how it can be used for A/B testing.

Take-home message: Always A/B test.

**Relevance**

Split is a useful tool for creating and managing feature flags for applications. This tool also allows different roll out methods to be implemented such as A/B testing. This technique is useful for the continuous delivery part of DevOps. 

In devops, A/B testing is a method that can be used to compare different versions of the same application based usage data of specific user groups. Based on the data, the team can go ahead and make more informed decisions on which features to implement. This allows for fast feedback and decisions can be made from data and not just individual opinions.
