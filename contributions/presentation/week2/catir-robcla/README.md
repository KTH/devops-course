## Description

We want to give a presentation with an introduction to Playwright. Playwright is an open source framework that enables automated testing for UI of web apps supporting chromium, firefox, and web-kit, and is available for several popular programming languages. 
We will first explain why automated UI testing is needed to fill the gaps of regular unit tests. We will then introduce Playwright and show small examples of its usage, including intercepting Api requests and returning expected results. 


**Relevance**

Running unit tests in a CI pipeline is a common practice to ensure the integrity of the software before allowing a merge. Even if every function is extensively tested and works as intended, the web app will still not work if its elements are not correctly mapped to their corresponding functions. Automating UI testing in the CI pipeline together with the unit tests ensures that your web app's components works as intended before deploying to production.
