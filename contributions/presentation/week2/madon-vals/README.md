## Title
Health of git repositories: the "bus factor". 

## Motivation
An interesting measurement to assess the health of a software project in the "bus factor": the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a bus before a project is incapacitated. Researchers have proposed algorithms to evaluate this number based on git history. 

In this presentation we intend to explain this concept, its potential usage and the algorithms proposed to compute it. We will then expand to other metrics that can be extracted from a git repository.

## Outline
- the "bus factor"
  - what is it?
  - how can it be used?
  - algorithms to compute it
- other analytics to assess the health of a software project
