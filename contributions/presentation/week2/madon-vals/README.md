## Title
Health of git repositories: the "bus factor". 

## Motivation
An interesting measurement to assess the health of a software project in the "bus factor": the minimal number of developers that have to be hit by a bus before a project is incapacitated. Reasearchers have proposed algorithms to evaluate this number based on git history. 

In this presentation we intend to explain this concept, its potential usage and the algorithms proposed to compute it. We may expend to other topics depending on the discussion with TAs.

## Outline
TODO: yet to be written based on the discussion with TAs
