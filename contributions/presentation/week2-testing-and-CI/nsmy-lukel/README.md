## Description

We intend to present various strategies which could be used to shorten test suite runtime in industry settings.
Often, tests suites on larger software applications can take upwards of 30 minutes to run in full. While the practice of
running all tests is a core principle of CI practice, it also hinders developer productivity. 

Our presentation will discuss strategies DevOps practitioners can use to shorten test suite runtimes. Initial ideas
include parallelization of unit tests, CAREFUL parallelization of integration tests, increased resource allocation, only
running tests that cover modified code, and stochastically selecting unhelpful tests to skip over.

We are unaware of any existing tools that are designed to help with this problem and would love to learn more about them
as well if staff or other students have any suggestions!
