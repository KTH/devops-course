## Description

One of the most crucial aspects of the software development process is software verification. The most commonly used way of performing software verification is through the process of testing. Often a large part of the tests in a test suite are written at the start of a project and only partially extended as the code base grows. The effect of this is that the degree of code that is covered by the tests, the coverage, is reduced. A low degree of coverage could result in false negatives in the software verification process where code is thought to be safe when in reality it is not. 

We propse a presentation on the topic of integrating coverage analysis with existing and popular unit testing frameworks for the Python programming langauge.
