## Description

Robot Framework is a automation framework used for test automation and robotic process automation (RPA). The syntax is based on keywork, making it easy to read.  

It can be used with powerful external libraries,such as Selenium. With these librairies one can use Robot Framework with difference software (brower, excel, mobile application ...). 

We plan to make a presentation on how to use Robot Framework to do user testing, and explain why it is useful to have easy-to-read test.
