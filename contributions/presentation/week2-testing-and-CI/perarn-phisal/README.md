## Description
With the emergence of the NodeJS ecosystem, JavaScript became universally usable on both the frontend and backend side. However, with a multitude of developers being part of this ecosystem, one has the option to choose from a huge selection of tools. Unit and integration testing are an integral part of a consistent software stack, but what are the best tools for each area?

This presentation will give an overview of various unit testing as well as integration testing frameworks that exist in this space, considering both pure JavaScript as well as more advanced environments like React and Express. Thus, we will compare the various frameworks and present their applicability to some of the most common JavaScript-based environments.
