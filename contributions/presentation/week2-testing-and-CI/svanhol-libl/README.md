## Description

During October of 2021 Facebooks entire network went down during a period of over six hours. This included all Metas services including Facebook, Whatsapp, Instagram and Sign in with Facebook. this was not due to any server is network malfunction but rather due to human error.
The entire network was theoretically fully operational but was disconnected from the outside world. Many of their systems and interal tools that wouldÂ´ve been used to revert and fix the issue went down in the process so fixing the issue was not an easy task. 

The problem did not occur imdediatly but gradually cascading out through out the network so catching the problem wasn't that simple.

How did this happen and could it have been mitigated by broad network configuration/ distributed systems testing.
