## Description

Serverless technologies are great but often developers want to orchestrate multiple actions as part of a business process in response to certain event. Orchestrating actions within a distributed systems can be challenging for many reasons such as:

- Often there're many actions involved (e.g., calls to serverless function, transforming event data, making decisions, ...etc.)
- The need for visual feedback to know which steps where executed successfully and which are not.

In this presentation I'll show you what's AWS Step Functions, why you may need it, and how it can help you to orchestrate your serverless workload.
