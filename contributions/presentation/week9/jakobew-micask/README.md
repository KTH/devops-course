## Description
Bots are a very common feature of GitHub repos, and they are used for automating repetitive tasks within the development process. Use cases range from dependency management, code review, handling vulnerabilities, etc. These bots can potentially make the workflow more efficient, but it's not a certainty. There are several challenges that limit their usefulness.

Our presentation aims to inform about issues with GitHub bots that have been discussed in recently published papers. Bot noisiness and false alarms will be the primary issues and we will also discuss how to mitigate them.


**Relevance**

GitHub bots are, as mentioned above, very popular and they help in automating the software development process. Thus, they fit well into the DevOps pipeline. What makes the topic interesting is that the potential negative effects of bots are rarely discussed as frequently as the positive ones.
