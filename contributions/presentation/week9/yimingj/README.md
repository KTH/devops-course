## Description

I'll introduce a fault injection system called ChaosOrca, which focuses on system calls in containerized applications. Then I will discuss and analysis the behavior of containerized applications under perturbations.

Here is the related [material](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X).

**Relevance**

ChaosOrca's integration of chaos engineering can help test the resilience of containerized applications, identifying potential problems in system call.
