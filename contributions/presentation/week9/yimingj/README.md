## Description

I'll introduce a fault injection system called ChaosOrca, which focuses on system calls in containerized applications. Then I will discuss and analysis the behavior of containerized applications under perturbations.

Here is the related [material](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.future.2021.04.001).

**Relevance**

ChaosOrca's integration of chaos engineering can help test the resilience of containerized applications, identifying potential problems in system call.
