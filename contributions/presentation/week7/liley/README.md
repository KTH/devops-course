**Relevance**

Licenses are an important topic for legal compliance and risk mitigation, especially if the produced software product is supposed to be re-licensed and sold. As one can see with the license change of elasticsearch from an open-source Apache 2.0 license to a more restrictive Server Side Public License (SSPL), software licensing can have a massive impact on companies and software products.
