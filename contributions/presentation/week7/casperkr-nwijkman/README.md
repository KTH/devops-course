## Description

In this presentation, we will explore how large technical companies manage DevOps practices in environments where thousands of independent services are deployed. We will discuss the complexities of scaling continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, service dependencies, and ensuring consistency across a vast number of services. The presentation will also touch on techniques like automation, standardization, and repository federation to handle the complexity of these architectures.

**Relevance**

This topic is highly relevant as modern enterprises increasingly adopt microservices architectures, resulting in many independent services that require robust DevOps processes. Managing these services at scale is a significant challenge, and understanding the strategies for automation and scaling can help improve the reliability and efficiency of DevOps practices in large, complex systems.
