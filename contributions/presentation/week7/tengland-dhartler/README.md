## Description

As DevOps becomes an increasingly adopted practice, providing sufficent security has become a more complex endeviour. DevSecOps is an approach which seeks to integrate security throughout the IT lifecycle. One principle in DevSecOps is not not only pervent breaches but *assume them* as well. One way to imporve in threat detection and response is to engage in *war games*, in which simulated attacks on the system are ochestrated and managed by the DevOps team. We want to introduce the topic of War Games (more specifically, red & blue teams) and motivate their relevance in the field of DevSecOps.  

**Relevance**

DevSecOps can, and should, be seen as a necessary extension of DevOps principles, as there is a requirement for modern systems to be secure. The change in developement processes has caused a need to rethink security and we belive that war games can be a good practice to complement your DevOps workflows.
