## Description

sigstore is a set of tools developers, software maintainers, package managers and security experts can benefit from. More specifically, it makes sure that your software is what it claims to be. It was started to improve supply chain technology for anyone using open source projects. In this presentation, it will be given an overview of how this tool works and which are the benefits of using it.

*Relevance*

This topic is very relevant for DevSecOps as the origin of some software that is frequently used is unknown, which means hard-to-spot risks to the integrity of the services. Without constant identity checks and safety protocols for keys and secrets, open source dependencies can open the door to breaches, exploits and supply chain attacks.
