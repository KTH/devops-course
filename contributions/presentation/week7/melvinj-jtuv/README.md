## Description

In this presentation we will first describe traditional methods of log monitoring. We will then describe the current state of automatic AI log monitoring, including the underlying operating principles of them. Finally comparing and contrasting these two methods.

**Relevance**

This topic is relevant because traditional monitoring is limited to act on either predefined anomalies, or for a predefined limit of when the logs are considered an anomaly. In contrast AI anomaly detection tools are a new technology that is rapidly advancing, and which could potentially make log monitoring much more effective.
