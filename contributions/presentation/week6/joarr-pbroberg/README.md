# Presentation on Docker and its use in DevOps

## Planned topic

Docker - What it is, a bit on how it is implemented, and why it is useful in DevOps.

## Relevance 

Docker is a great tool for DevOps teams since it helps avoid problems that occur when many team members work in parallel on the same project. Docker eliminates issues that that occur from using different development environments since the code is run in a container, which provides an isolated and identical environment regardless of where the code is run. We would therefore like to learn more about how Docker is implemented, how it differs from using a virtual machine and why these differences has led to such popularity and widespread adoption.

## Outline of presentation

In three main sections we will attempt to answer these questions:

- What is docker? What does it provide to a developer?
- How is docker implemented "under the hood"? How does it differ from using a Virtual Machine?
- What advantages and drawbacks follow from these differences?
