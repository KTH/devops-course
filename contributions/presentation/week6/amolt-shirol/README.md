## Description

This presentation focuses on Synthetic Monitoring as a stage in Continuous Deployment and explores a tool called Checkly to perform browser and API monitoring.

We describle how to setup monitoring on websites and on APIs, and how easy it is to assess the health of the overall system.

Finally, we will reflect on the need for this and discuss a case study where synthetic monitoring had a positive effect on the product.

**Relevance**

Monitoring is an integral part of the continuous deployment cycle. Specifically, it can help with early detection of issues, performance optimization, reducing downtimes, and improved user experience.

There are a lot of new tools that are emerging which allow us to monitor the state of our software and provide insights about perfomance and other elements. As a devops engineer, one should know about the existing solutions in the market.
