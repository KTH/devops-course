## Description

This presentation will focus on feature flags in the beginning and motivate why organisations use them. Further, split.io will be introduced which is a solution to centrally manage feature flags and aids organisations to integrate feature flag deployment.

**Relevance**

Week 6 will focus on feature flags. Feature flags allow developers and organisations to distinguish different code paths in their systems. Nevertheless, one needs 
a management of these code paths if one fully relies on feature flags. For example the feature flag "PRO_CLIENT" may change over time as well as contains multiple
conditions under which a client is a "PRO_CLIENT" - i.e. registered after date X and is on plan PRO. For this purpose, split.io gives a management tool to centrally
manage this.
