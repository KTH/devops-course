# Presentation of novel decentralized discussion tool

The idea behind the tool is like an internet forum, except everyone in the forum has a massive text file which also includes other information that can be parsed by the tool. The advantages of this are many, everyone can verify that previous posts have not been edited, everyone stores a backup and anyone can fork the forum. Additionally, it doesn't matter how the file is distributed, meaning that the discussion will not be lost in time as soon as a server goes down and no one needs to trust a server owner. The tool will also provide authentication of who wrote what using private/public key cryptography.

I decided to make a presentation about this as I think it will naturally be very interesting and I'll have fun talking about it. I'll also publish it on github in case anyone wants to try it out but I will not submit it as "submission to open source" even though it is in a sense.
