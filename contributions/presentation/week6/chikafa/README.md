# Presentation Proposal: Microservices Contract Testing (Week 6)

I would like to make a presentation about Microservices Contract Testing. Contract Testing is a way to ensure that services (such as an API provider and a client) can communicate with each other. Without contract testing, the only way to know that services can communicate is by using expensive and brittle integration tests. Contract testing is therefore an easy way to test microservices as we donâ€™t need to spin up the whole platform.
