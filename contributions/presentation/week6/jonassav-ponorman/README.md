## Description

_Dynatrace is a monitoring tool to simplify the process of monitoring cloud releases that takes advantage of AI in order to automate anomaly detection and deployment strategies. We want to give an overview of Dynatrace and present its potential benefits within the DevOps pipeline in comparison to other monitoring tools on the market and we want to talk about how some of the benefits allow Dynatrace to automate release decisions and automatic rollback in deployment strategies such as Canary deployment with their Canary Tracker._

**Relevance**

_Monitoring is essential in ensuring a functioning CI/CD pipeline by detecting potential errors and enabling various deployment strategies. Dynatrace has the potential to further automate and enhance deployment strategies which is very relevant for DevOps._
