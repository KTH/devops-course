## Topic

[CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql/) is an analysis engine developed by GitHub. This engine treats code as data to detect security vulnerabilities, bugs, or other errors. Since it is developed by GitHub it can easily be integrated within your GitHub repository to do continuous analysis of your code. Also, since this is an open source project we also want to emphasize how you can contribute to this project by adding additional queries to the open source database.

## Outline

-   What CodeQL is
-   How it works
-   How queries are constructed
-   How to utilise CodeQL
-   How to integrate it with your GitHub repository
-   How to contribute with queries
-   Reflection
-   Take home message
