## Description

The presentation will explore the concept of dynamic secrets in HashiCorp Vault, a feature that enhances security in managing sensitive information. Unlike static secrets, which are fixed and need to be manually rotated, dynamic secrets are generated on-the-fly and have a limited lifespan, reducing the risk of exposure and simplifying management.

**Relevance**

Dynamic secrets are crucial for DevSecOps as they provide automated, temporary credentials that enhance security and reduce manual management. It also minimizes the risk of credential leaks.
