## Presentation: An overview of serverless computing

#### Topic
We want present an overview of severless computing for the students of this course. We think this is a great subject as ´serverless computing´ is something that is being talked about a lot and we feel like our understanding about this topic can be expanded upon.

If we feel this way, there probably is another student that feels the same.

The aim to present the following:
  - Overview of serverless computing (1 min)
  - Advantages/disadvantages of serverless compared to traditional cloud hosting (2 min)
  - Devops (testing/deploying) in serverless (2 min)
  - Comparison of different service providers/cloud platforms (2 min)

If it turns out that we have more time on our hands, we'd also like to present:

- An example of serverless: case study (architecture)


#### Relevance
Serverless DevOps goes beyond how IT organizations can achieve greater business agility. It’s geared towards the rapid delivery of business value and continuous improvement and learning. Organizations can deliver new products and features quicker and it's cheaper to change the culture in the process.


#### Goal 
We want to get a distinction and we've given it some thought on how; We think that we can do that by having a relevant, well-structured, clear message that will engage the audience.
