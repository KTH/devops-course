## Description

In this presentation, we will introduce the concept of Static Application Security Testing (SAST), explain why it's important, and explain what problems it tries to solve. 
We’ll also demonstrate how and where Static Application Security Testing integrates into the process to enhance security early on in the DevOps pipeline.
From there, we will examine a tool that specifically analyzes Python code called Bandit. 
Bandit is a popular, open-source tool designed to identify common security vulnerabilities in Python by statically analyzing code. 
It creates an AST and runs a set of plugins to examine the AST nodes for potential security risks. 
Finally, we are going to assess the effectiveness of such a tool in the general context of DevSecOps. 

**Relevance**
Static security analysis is an important early step in the DevOps pipeline. By shifting security testing left (earlier in the pipeline) as well as
automating with tools such as Bandit, we can reduce development time and cost.
