## Topic

The presentation will be about Mobile backend as a service (MBaaS). MBaaS is related to DevOps because it automates parts of the customers backend code, making some services run on some other server rather than on the host.

## Outline
- What is MBaaS?
- Why is it important?
- What is a cloud function?
- How does this relate to DevOps?
- Some examples of some MBaaS services (Firebase and Parse Server)
