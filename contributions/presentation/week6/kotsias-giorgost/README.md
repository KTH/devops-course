## Description
Docker revolutionized the way for developing, shipping and running applications. Docker's container based platform allows 
for highly portable workloads. By taking advantage of several features of the Linux kernel (namespaces and control groups)
, Docker provides app isolation. In this presentation, we aim to present Docker's inner security features and how they 
can potentially be attacked. Furthermore, we will shortly discuss how these security features compare to different container
technologies, such as LXC.

## Presentation Outline
* Security features of Docker
* Possible Docker security vulnerabilities
* Docker vs LXC
