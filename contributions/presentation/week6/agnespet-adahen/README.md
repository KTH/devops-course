# Presentation Proposal

## Topic
Our presentation will be about end-to-end testing and about one of the most modern e2e testing frameworks on the market today, Cypress. We will shortly explain how having e2e tests produce customer value, the problems with the most widely used legacy tool today (Selenium), the novel features of Cypress, and how you can start using it today. 

## Outline
- What are integration tests and end-to-end tests?
- Why is it important?
- Features:
- - Screenshots & video for isolating issues more easily.
- - The command log (and cache)
- How does Cypress differentiate itself from its grandfather Selenium?
- - The problem with modern SPA’s, selenium web-driver, and flaky test suites. 
- Show how easy it is to set up a basic test suite against a react app
- Basic principles like:
- - environment mocking: Login test with mocking the user
- - component testing: Forms
