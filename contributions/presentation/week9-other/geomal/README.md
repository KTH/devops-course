## Description

With DevOps becoming more and more complex monitoring becomes much more difficult to handle manually. New system architectures such as micro-services can consist of containerised infrastructures with many processes. Many of the systems that we use are interconnected. The more complex the systems become the more important it becomes to have some form of insight over where errors could occur och where more resources are needed. These problems can be solved with Prometheus, a powerful and open-source platform which makes monitoring a system much easier. I will attempt to explain why monitoring is important and give and overview of why Prometheus is a good tool to use.
