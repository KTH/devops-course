## Description

CD in MLOps is a very interesting and common topic. We found that MLOps differs from Devops because it contains an extra step called Continuous Training. We felt this might be a good topic to provide some insights on. We also delve into Kubeflow and see how that would help in CI/CD/CT for MLOps
