## Description

When looking at the positive sides of DevOps it is common that most of the focus lies on productivity increases and economical benefits. We want to explore and present DevOps from the perspective of environmental sustainability. How the different tools, methods and workflows in a production line can have a positive or negative impact on for example a company's carbon footprint and energy use.
