## Description

When first contributing to open source projects, many programmers find themselves confused about the conventions and expectations that other people in this space have. Over the years, many different standard practices revolving around open source projects for different programming languages have emerged.

This presentation will give an overview of various common conventions for open source projects of different sizes and how these conventions can aid in large-scale project management and maintaining. Some topics that will be discussed are:

- commit message format
- common issue and pull request labels
- changelog formatting
- choosing a suitable open source license
- which sections a good readme should contain and how it can make a project look more trustworthy and production-ready
- indicators to determine which open source project or library is the best long-term choice (e.g. that it has recent commits, a vibrant community, several responsible contributors, possibly backed by a company)

Various examples of well-known open source projects and how they apply these standards will be given.
