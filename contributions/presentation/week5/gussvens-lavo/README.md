## Description

We want to demo how to setup Azure infrastructure resources using the Bicep language. The demo will show how to edit and setup a similar environment in a different Azure region.

**Relevance**
Microsoft Azure is the largest cloud computing provider however their DSL bicep for IAC on MS Azure is not as common as similar technologies such as Teraform or AWS cloud formation. The technologies differ in key aspects and we think it would be interesting to demo this technoloy to the rest of the course attendees.
