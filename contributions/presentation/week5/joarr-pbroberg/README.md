# Presentation on Docker and its use in DevOps

## Planned topic

Docker - What it is, a bit on how it is implemented, and why it is useful in DevOps.

## Relevance 

Docker is a great tool for DevOps teams since it helps avoid problems that occur when many team members work in parallel on the same project. Docker eliminates issues that that occur from using different development environments since the code is run in a container, which provides an isolated and identical environment regardless of where the code is run. We would therefore like to learn more both about how docker is used and how it is implemented.

## Outline of presentation

- What is docker_? What does it provide to a developer_?
- How do you get started with Docker_? What are the main use cases?
- How is docker implemented "under the hood"? How does it differ from using a Virtual Machine?
