## Description

This presentation will focus on comparing Pulumi and Terraform, two prominent Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, with a specific emphasis on language support and its effects on infrastructure management. Pulumi’s use of general-purpose programming languages (e.g., JavaScript, Python, Go) versus Terraform’s use of HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) introduces distinct advantages and challenges. The analysis will highlight which tool is better suited for various use cases depending on developer expertise and project complexity.

**Relevance**

Language support significantly impacts the ease and flexibility of infrastructure management. Pulumi allows developers to use familiar languages, potentially improving productivity and collaboration across teams, while Terraform's declarative approach offers simplicity and focus on infrastructure logic. Understanding the impact of these differences is essential for making informed decisions about which tool to adopt based on project needs and team capabilities.
