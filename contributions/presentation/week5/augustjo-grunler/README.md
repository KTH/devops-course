### Proposal
We plan to give a introductory presentation about Flaky tests and their role in DevOps. Flaky tests could make testing hard to automate because you cant fully rely on the results.

#### outline
* What are flaky tests
* How do they happen
* How are they handeled in DevOps
* Why you might still include flaky tests
