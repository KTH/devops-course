## Description

We aim to describe how grains, states, and pillars in Salt can be implemented to get infrastructure as code. 
By describing the relation and different uses of these features a better understanding of how Salt works, and why it is an option for DevOps, can be acquired. 
We will provide examples of how different configurations impact the overall structure of the infrastructure.
Finally we will discuss pros and cons of Saltstack compared to other similar automation frameworks.

**Relevance**

Since Saltstack is a technology used for configuration management and IT automation, among other things, it relates to DevOps. 
Several of its features, which the presentation will describe and delve into, are using the infrastructure as code paradigm.
