## Description

The presentation explores how DevOps teams can leverage Infrastructure as Code (IaC) practices to effectively manage cloud resources and reduce operational costs. It covers strategies for automating infrastructure provisioning, scaling, and decommissioning, ensuring that resources are only consumed when needed. The presentation emphasizes using IaC tools like Terraform to track, audit, and optimize costs in cloud environments by defining resource configurations programmatically.

**Relevance**

This topic is highly relevant to the DevOps course because it integrates essential concepts of automation, cloud infrastructure management, and operational efficiency. By understanding cost optimization through IaC, students can apply DevOps principles like continuous delivery, scalability, and resource management to real-world scenarios, ensuring that both performance and cost efficiency are balanced in the systems they develop and maintain.
