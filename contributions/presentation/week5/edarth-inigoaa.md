In the cloud native environment it is not require any more to manage your own servers manually. Developers are creating new tools that allows you to simplify this task. Terraform is one of the most popular tools for managing infrastructure as code. It allows you to define your infrastructure in a configuration file and then deploy it to the cloud. This is a very powerful tool that allows you to automate the deployment of your infrastructure.

This technology allows us to adopt easily the DevOps workflow even with the infrastructure, helping us create a scalable and maintainable infrastructure.
