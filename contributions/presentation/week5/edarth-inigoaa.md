## Description
In our presentation, we will explain how to deploy cloud infrastructure efficiently using Terraform. We will give an overview of the total, explaining how things were done in the past and how Terraform improved this process for modern development. We will also show some examples of how to deploy cloud infrastructure using Terraform.

**Relevance**

In the cloud-native environment, it is not required any more to manage your servers manually. Developers are creating new tools that allow you to simplify this task. Terraform is one of the most popular tools for managing infrastructure as code. It allows you to define your infrastructure in a configuration file and then deploy it to the cloud. This is a very powerful tool that allows you to automate the deployment of your infrastructure.

This technology allows us to adopt easily to the DevOps workflow even with the infrastructure, helping us create a scalable and maintainable infrastructure.
