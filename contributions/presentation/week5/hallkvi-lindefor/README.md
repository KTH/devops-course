## Description

In this presentation we aim to dive deep into the differences between declaring infrastructure as imperative and declarative, discuss the benefits and drawbacks of the very common tool terraform and compare it to AWS SDK. During the presentation we will have two examples set up side by side.

**Relevance**

While it is widely accepted that infrastructure as code is necessary to some extent there are many approaches. Better understanding the pros/cons of the structurally different approaches is necessary to make an informed decision.
