## Description

Helm provides a simpler way to manage Kubernetes projects. The way to do so is creating so-called Helm Charts,
where each Chart is a collection of one or many individual Kubernets manifests. The charts can also have child charts
and other dependencies, and so using Helm means you as a user can install the whole project using a single command
instead of installing individual components and puzzling them together. This, along with many other features of Helm,
provides a helpful way of using Kubernetes to orchestrate containers.

**Relevance**

Helm is widely known as the package manager for Kubernetes, the container orchestration framework adapted by many huge 
companies such as Google and Spotify, and highly relevant in the topic of DevOps due to its ability to simplify application 
deployment, standardize deployments and provide effective configuration management.
