## Description

This presentation explains how Terraform remote state backends improve team collaboration by addressing the limitations of local state files, which prevents conflicts and ensures a secure and consistent infrastructure. 

**Relevance**

Managing infrastructure with local state files leads to inconsistencies and conflicts, especially when working with rapid iteration, collaboration and automation such as in DevOps. Terraform remote state backends solve these challenges by centralizing infrastructure states, which ease collaboration, ensures consistency and integrating securely into CI/CD pipelines. This makes them important for a scalable and reliable infrastructure management in a DevOps environment.
