 ## Description
Git has been the backbone of any collaborative software project for years. However, with the rise of GitHub and other Git related services, very few rising software engineers know about the fucntionality of Git, specifically Git Hooks. They allow to manipulate commits and add a control layer over them, by, for example, checking that a commit message corresponds to a specific format for easier version control.

We are going to cover different Git Hooks, what they can be used for, and give some basic examples.
