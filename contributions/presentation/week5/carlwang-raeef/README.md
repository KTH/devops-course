## Description
The presentation is about Vagrant, an open-source tool by HashiCorp that automates the creation and management of virtualized development enviroments, co-working with such as VirtualBox, VMware and Docker. With Vagrant, developers can quickly spin up reproducible VMs using a simple configuration file, to ensures consistency across different facilities, so to avoid such problems as "it works on my computer!". In this presentation, we will first introduce Vagrant, then move forward to its crucial feature while providing readable code snippets for better understanding. After these, a detailed reflection and a conclusion will be given.


**Relevance**
Understanding Vagrantâ€™s role within the IaC ecosystem is crucial for developers and DevOps engineers looking to streamline their development workflows. Vagrant allows developers to quickly provision environments that mirror production setups, which reduces the effects of the "works on my machine" problem. Furthermore, Vagrant is a flexible solution that improves automation and consistency throughout the development, testing, and deployment stages thanks to its connection with configuration management systems (like Ansible, Chef, and Puppet) and support for continuous integration (CI) pipelines.
