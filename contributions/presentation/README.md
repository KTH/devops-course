## Proposal

Mockito is an open source testing framework for Java released under the MIT License.[3][4] The framework allows the creation of test double objects (mock objects) in automated unit tests for the purpose of test-driven development (TDD) or behavior-driven development (BDD). 

We will go through a global presentation of Mockito: what are its pros and cons comparing to other solutions, then we'll focus on its specifities and advanced features.
