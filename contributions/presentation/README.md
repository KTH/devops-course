## How to Register Your Topic

Make a pull-request based on the following steps:

- create a folder with your group name (like `T1G1`)
- in your folder, create a README.md file and put your topic information there

TA will review the PR. If it is accepted, you could begin your work on this topic, and make another pull-request to submit your work in the future.

## Final Submission

You should make another pull-request with the following files structure:

```
Your group folder
├─ README.md (should already exist, update it if necessary, e.g. a link to your slides, links to relevant materials)
├─ ***.pdf (the pdf version of your slides)
└─ other files you want to share as well
```
