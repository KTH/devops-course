## How to Register Your Topic

Make a pull-request based on the following steps:

- create a subfolder in folder `weekX`, which you plan to give a presentation in, following the name convention of using email addresses of two members: email-email
- in your folder, create a README.md file and put there:
   - the planned topic, which must be focused enough
   - a short statement (1-3 sentences) about the relevance and timeliness for testing and devops
   - bullet outline of the presentation  

TAs will review the PR and check fo relevance. If it is accepted, you could begin your work on this topic, and make another pull-request to submit your work in the future. Note that each week, no more than **6** presentations will be arranged.
