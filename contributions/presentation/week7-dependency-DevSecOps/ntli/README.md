## Description

I would like to show how automatic vulnerability testing can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines. 
In doing so, I would like to introduce the different approaches: Static Analysis (SAST), Dynamic Testing (DAST) and Software Composition Analysis (SCA).
For each approach I want to show what kind of vulnerabilities can be avoided, and what tools are available for this.
