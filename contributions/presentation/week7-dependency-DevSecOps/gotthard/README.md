## Description

The presentation would explore how Blockchain technology could be leveraged in package/dependency management. The talk would outline the some of the problems with a centralized package registry, and how blockchain could potentially be a solution to them. As there are no widely used (as far as I could find) package management solution that use blockchain, the main source of information would be from research. Here are some sources:

- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9219374
- https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8671614
- http://norma.ncirl.ie/3300/ (A master thesis)
- https://ed-burton.medium.com/creating-a-blockchain-distributed-package-manager-for-front-end-enterprise-ci-cd-pipelines-2fe458945b22 (medium article)

You could say that the presentation would be a "glance" into a potential future where these kinds of dependency management solutions are more commonly used.
