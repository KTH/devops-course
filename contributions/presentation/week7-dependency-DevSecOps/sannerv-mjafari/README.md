# Description
A supply chain attack is where an organisations network is breached through vulnerabilities in its supply chain. The vulnerabilities are apparent in some vendor of the supply chain which in result can cause breaches of its customers. Supply Chain attacks are a major threat to companies and organisations since it is hard to control the security of every part of your supply chain. Also the breach of one vendor might affect a large ammount of organisations which are all dependant on the software deployed by the vendor. One major incident of a supply chain attack was the SolarWinds hack which affected thousands of enterprises and government agencies worldwide.

In this presentation we will explain why Supply Chain attacks are an important topic of DevSecOps, go through some examples of supply chain attacks, and bring up some methods that can be used in DevOps to counteract these types of attacks such as with Azure Sentinel and Intrustion Detection Systems.
