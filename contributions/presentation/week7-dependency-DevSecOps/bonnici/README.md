## Description

I would like to give a presentation about JFrog Artifactory, a Universal Binary Repository Manager that provides end-to-end automation and 
managing of binaries and artifacts throughout the software development process. In doing so, I intend to explain the problem of not using a binary repository manager, i.e. fetching dependecies from their central repositories in each step of the software developemnt process and show how JFrog Artifactory can help counter those problems in a fast and reliable way. Furthermore, I would also like to show how JFrog Artifactory can be easily integrated into the CI/CD pipeline and what benfits this yields.
