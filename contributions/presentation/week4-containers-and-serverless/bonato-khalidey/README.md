## Description

In Machine Learning, developing and deploying ML models is a core task for ML engineers. 
One of the issues involved in this is that many developers and contributors work in different environments/platforms which can make it difficult to develop the 
models due to dependencies and configurations that may be required in different environments. We would like to give a very brief introduction 
into what Machine Learning is, how this relates to DevOps through MLOps then give an introduction into what containers are and the role they can play in the 
development and deployment of ML models.
This is an opportunity to show how the field of DevOps also has major benefits in the ML industry (MLOps).
