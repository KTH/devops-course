## Description

We want to do a presentation on A/B testing. Explaining why it can provide great value for product owners and developers alike. If it is okay we would like to lean into the business perspective since we are both Industrial Engineering students.

**Relevance**

We think that understanding comparative testing methods is important to being able to actually use ML tools in practice. According to the MLOps wikipedia page, very few users of MLOps-practices actually found any real world benefits and being able to reliably test is key in determining whether or not to use it.
