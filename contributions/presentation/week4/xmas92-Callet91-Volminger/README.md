## Topic
Test Amplification in DevOps
 
## The primary outline of the presentation
- [Introduction] What is test amplification and how does it relate to mutation testing?
- [Motivation] How could this be useful in the DevOps pipeline.
- [Technical] Dspot, good example of mutation testing for test amplification.
- [Complement] Tools that can complement test amplification to validate generated test cases. (Maybe see how a tool like Dspot and PIT could be used together, maybe not if it is to far from DevOps)
- Conclusions and discussion about Dspot, its relevance for DevOps and tools that complement test amplification

 
 
## Relevance to DevOps
- Can be used as a good complement for testing in CI/CD pipelines.
- Automatic Unit Test Amplification for DevOps(https://tel.archives-ouvertes.fr/tel-02396530/document and https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.08330.pdf)
- Increases the quality of test cases automatically and hence minimizes manual generated unit tests and labour costs.
