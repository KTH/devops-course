#Topic: DevOps and security
DevSecOps, what is it? Why do you need it?


#A short statement (1-3 sentences) about the relevance and timeliness for testing and devops
As development is very agile, requirements change quickly, developers need to keep up to be able to deliver faster. DevOps as a framework helps developers achieve this. Security is also very important but is sometimes left behind as it can be slow and costly. DevSecOps is here to fix that.
