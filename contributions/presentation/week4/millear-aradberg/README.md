## Description

Jupyter Notebook is used by many data scientists to create their ML workflows. Usually many different notebooks are needed to structure their projects and instead of running each notebook manually, Elyra makes it possible to create a reusable machine learning pipeline. Elyra is an open-source extension to JupyterLab and the main feature is its visual pipeline editor which gives a clear representation of the machine learning workflow. It can be run either locally on JupyterLab for small projects or remotely for larger projects using Kubeflow Pipelines.

**Relevance**

Elyra is a tool created for building ML pipelines, simplifying the conversion of multiple notebooks or script files into batch jobs or workflows.
