## Abstract

SonarQube is a tool allowing Continuous Code Inspection. This practice is a part of the Continuous Integration pipeline and helps to push scalable and secure changes to an application. In the presentation, we will explain the stakes of Continuous Code Inspection and what is SonarQube’s answer to the problem.
