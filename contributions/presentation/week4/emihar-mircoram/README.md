## Description

Description:
The default configuration for a Kafka broker is designed to handle message sizes of approximately 1 MB. To increase this limit, it is necessary to adjust settings on both the client and broker sides, as well as any other affected components within the integration. Emerging solutions, such as the open-source component "ClaimCheck" developed by the Swedish IT company Irori, aim to address this issue more effectively. This presentation draws inspiration from Irori's solution.

*Relevance*

This presentation will explore the synergistic relationship between Kafka and Kubernetes in supporting an event-driven microservice architecture. Additionally, it will delve into a specific technology, offering valuable insights into the development of innovative solutions.
