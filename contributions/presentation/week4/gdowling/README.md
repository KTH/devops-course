# Presentation of novel decentralized discussion protocol + tool

I had a discussion with Prof. Benoit Baudry about how this protocol and tool for reading/creating the protocol could potentially be within the scope of devOps.

Sketching out the features of the protocol:

-one long text file containing an entire discussion topic

-only ever add to it, never remove, can therefore verify with older versions

-adding new discussion items

-providing additional proof for items

-adding fixes to items

-adding proof to the contrary for items

-optional identities with username/password, can be created and verified using cryptography (I am fairly certain)

One use case for this could be for example if you discuss philosophy and want to prove or disprove some claim, you only need to send text files back and forth through any mean and can then add new information and even make it publically viewable, the public can still read and verify that it has not been tampered with and if enabled who wrote it and also for every claim can see how many others agree/disagree and their rationales.

I'll flesh out exactly what features are useful and a better explanation shortly.

I decided to make a presentation about this as I think it will naturally be very interesting and I'll have fun talking about it. I'll also publish it on github in case anyone wants to try it out but I will not submit it as "submission to open source" even though it is in a sense.
