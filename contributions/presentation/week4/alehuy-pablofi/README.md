## Description

We will introduce the concept of data drift in machine learning and why it is a problem in the area of ML. We will then introduce EvidentlyAI, an ML Model monitoring tool which among other things can help detect data drift and also show how you can integrate this tool into your existing projects.


**Relevance**

This is relevant due to the fact that data drift is an important challenge for ML models development, especially for smaller sized teams. Evidently AI proposes a lightweight, open-source solution to manage this issue automatically.
