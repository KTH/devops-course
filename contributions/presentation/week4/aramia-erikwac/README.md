## Description

This presentation seeks to introduce Apptainer (formerly singularity), which is an open source container platform which seeks to cater to the use of high performance computing (HPC). It achieves this by placing an emphasis on integration and configuration of GPUs, high speed networks and parallel filesystems. It also has security features which allow for effective encryption of the image to ensure secure portability.

**Relevance**

Containerization has long had a central role in the devops environment, and is in many regards an essential part of it. This is relevant to the utilization of devops within HPC specifically.
