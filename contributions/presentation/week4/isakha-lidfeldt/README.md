### Proposal:
Open-source DevOps tools possess extensive benefits to companies and consumers alike. The tools allows for faster and cheaper development for both the open source community and the private sector. Today, traditional companies with high security restrictions struggle with fully embracing DevOps as a lot of the tools being used are fully or partially open-source tools. Additionally, open-source attacks are becoming more frequent.

This presentation will illustrate the challenges companies in e.g. the defense industry face when using open-source code in a high security environment. We will give examples from personal working experience at one of these companies (SAAB, a Swedish defense contractor).

The topics that will be covered are:
* Background SAAB - how far have they come in DevOps
* Open-source DevOps tools, brief overview
* Open-source attacks
* Workflow for importing new tools
