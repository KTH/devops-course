## Description

We will make a presentation on the importance of code reviews. We will present some empirical studies on code reviews and then on the topic of AI show off [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai/), an automated tool for LLM-based code reviews. We will show how this can be used as a part of your DevOps pipeline and discuss the importance of re-reviewing the code you wrote before deploying it to production. 

**Relevance**

Code reviews takes up a huge part of your time when working as a software developer but it is critical to discuss and review changes to the codebase when working in bigger teams. In the future AI will also take part in this which will save a lot of time for senior engineers reviewing junior engineers code.
