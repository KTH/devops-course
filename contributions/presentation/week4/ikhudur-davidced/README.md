## Description

We want to present the relatively new Azure service **Azure Container Apps**, explain what it is, and the pros and cons of it. We are going to make a comparison between Azure Container Apps and Azure Kubernetes Services (AKS), and why Azure Container Apps is more/less suitable than AKS.

**Relevance**

Azure Container Apps is a relatively new service from Microsoft that allows you to "*run microservices and containerized applications on a serverless platform*" [1]. This is relevant to DevOps because removes the need to manage the underlying infrastructure and provides a simplified way of deploying containerized applications.
