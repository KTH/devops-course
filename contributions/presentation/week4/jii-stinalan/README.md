## Agenda for the presentation
We want to learn more about the DevOps culture and how it affects organizations and it's members. DevOps includes a lot of technical fields, and we think (including ourselves) that most of the people associate DevOps with fields such as Computer Science and Information Technology. However, a big part of the DevOps is based on human psychology, and to be able to adopt the principles of DevOps the humans need to work, collaborate and communicate in a new way.

The agenda for our presentation:

    - What is a "DevOps culture"?
        - What are the most important/significant parts?
    - Why is it important?
        - Advantages and benefits with this kind of culture
        - Statistics or data that shows the progress
    - Guidelines/Tips on how to start to build a DevOps culture
        - Give an example from a real company

## Criteria

We aim to achieve at least these criterias:

**timing: The presentation's length is exactly in 7-9**

**relevance: The presentation mostly contains relevant information**
* All the information provided has to do with DevOps or the DevOps culture. We have also included an example of a real team (HP LaserJet) that has created a DevOps culture that improves their workflow and productivity.

**well-structured: The presentation is well structured**
* Our plan is to divide the presentation into three parts, introduction, body and conclusion. In the introduction part we will give a motivation about the subject and give the audience a mentimeter question they can fill in. The body will consist of an explanation about DevOps in general, and then move over to an explanation about a DevOps culture. We will provide a motivation why it is important and also explain how to achieve such a culture. In the end of the body we will give an real world example of a company that created a DevOps culture. As conclusion we will summarize what we have talked about and give a concise take-home message. We will also close the loop by presenting the answers from the menimenter question in the beginning of the presentation.

**motivation: The presentation contains a good, motivating introduction**
* In the beginning of the presentation we will motivate why this is an interesting subject and what you gain by knowing this by connecting our topic to future job opportunities.

**originality: The presentation contains one part that is original**
* We use a word-could to interact with the audience easier. We also talk about another aspect of devops that is less common (in comparison to CI or containers for example).

**take-home: The last slide contains a good and concise take-home message**
* Yes, that "Communication is key".

**loudly: The speakers talk loudly and clearly**

**engagement: The speakers engage with the audience (eg eye-contact)**
* We use a mentimeter word cloud to achieve interaction that everyone can easily participate in. We also end the presentation with a word cloud comparison with our thoughts about DevOps culture after we have done this presentation.

**readable-slides: The slides don't have too much text**
* We want to bullet points so the audience can easily follow the presentation, and emphasize the important part of each sub topic in the presentation.

**illustration: The slides contain nice illustrations**
* We have tried to use relevant illustration for each slide, and we have also created our own illustration for gated commits :)

We will do our best for every criteria, but we believe that a remarkable grade is subjective but we will mainly focusing on achieving remarkable on this criterias:
* well-structured
* loudly
* engagement (using a interactive word cloud)
* illustration
