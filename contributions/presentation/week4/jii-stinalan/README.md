## Agenda for the presentation
We want to learn more about the DevOps culture and how it affects organizations and it's members. DevOps includes a lot of technical fields, and we think (including ourselves) that most of the people associate DevOps with fields such as Computer Science and Information Technology. However, a big part of the DevOps is based on human psychology, and to be able to adopt the principles of DevOps the humans need to work, collaborate and communicate in a new way. 

The agenda for our presentation:

    - What is a "DevOps culture"?
        - What are the most important/significant parts?
    - Why is it important?
        - Advantages and benefits with this kind of culture
        - Statistics or data that shows the progress
    - Guidelines/Tips on how to start to build a DevOps culture
        - Give an example from a real company
        
We would appreciate feedback on the topic and the agenda of the presentation.
