## Description

We want to do a presentation on the concept of the Feature Store. We will explain the significance of using a feature store when dealing with MLOps workflows and present its advantages. Specifically we will talk about how it enhances real-time (online) applications. In our presentation we use Feast as an example for an open-source feature store and provide according code-snippets.

**Relevance**

When not having a feature store, ML feature reusability is limited and ML engineers spent a significant amount of time on feature engineering. The concept of a feature store acts as a hub of callaboration and ensures consistency accross training and serving avoiding training-serving skew. Furthermore, features can be reused accross teams leading to additional time savings. Feature stores allow for a consistent and fast delivery of feature values in online, offline and training scenarios.
