## Description

We will start the presentation with a short introduction to MLOps and its shortcomings when it comes to comparing models. Then, we will look at the Tensorboard tool and present the different features it has. We will then try to show how it can be used in the MLOps workflow and try and justify its use instead of other alternatives.

**Relevance**

MLOps needs to constantly monitor various parameters regarding machine learning models. Because of this, using a visual tool can help in this process, and this is where Tensorboard can reveal itself to be very useful.
