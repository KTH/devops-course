## Description

This presentation starts with an introduction to Akka and its importances and advantanges in devops ecosystem, followed by the load-balancing problems of Akka. We then demostrates how Lagom solves the problem by finding the right boundaries between services and create right-sized (Lagom, a Swedish word meaning just right, sufficient) microservices to acheive scalability and resilience. The presentation ends with real-life application built with Lagom.

**Relevance**

Lagom is an open source framework for building systems of Reactive microservices in Java or Scala. Lagom builds on Akka and Play, proven technologies that are in production in some of the most demanding applications today.
