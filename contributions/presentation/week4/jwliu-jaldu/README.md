## Description

This presentation starts with an introduction to Akka and its importance and advantages in the DevOps ecosystem, followed by the load-balancing problems of Akka. We then demonstrate how Lagom solves the problem by finding the right boundaries between services and creating right-sized (Lagom, a Swedish word meaning just right, sufficient) microservices to achieve scalability and resilience. The presentation ends with real-life applications built with Lagom.

**Relevance**

Lagom is an open-source framework for building systems of Reactive microservices in Java or Scala. Lagom builds on Akka and Play, proven technologies that are in production in some of the most demanding applications today.
